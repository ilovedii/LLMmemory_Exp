    { "id": 1, "text": "Maya stared at her computer screen, the blue light reflecting off her glasses as she scrolled through social media. Everyone at school had their perfect online lives, while she felt invisible in the hallways. As she clicked on yet another classmate's vacation photo, her screen suddenly flickered. The internet connection symbol spun endlessly, but instead of an error message, strange words appeared: \"Welcome to Alternis.\" The screen rippled like water, and Maya felt a pull from somewhere deep inside. Her fingertips tingled as they passed through the screen like it was made of jelly. Before she could scream, Maya found herself standing in a vibrant forest clearing that seemed built from pure imagination, nothing like her boring suburban bedroom. A girl who looked exactly like Maya stood across from her, smiling with Maya's face but somehow different eyes." },
    { "id": 2, "text": "Maya stepped back, her heart racing as she stared at her mirror image. \"Who are you?\" she asked, her voice shaking. The doppelganger's smile widened, revealing teeth that seemed too white, too perfect. \"I'm you, but better,\" the other Maya replied, twirling around in the forest clearing. The vibrant colors of the trees seemed to bend toward her as she moved. Maya noticed a small glass bottle hanging from a branch nearby, filled with something that looked like milk but sparkled with tiny stars. A label on the bottle read \"Drink to return.\" The doppelganger followed Maya's gaze and frowned. \"You don't want to go back there, where nobody sees you,\" she said. \"Here in Alternis, everyone will notice you.\" Maya remembered how invisible she felt at school, how she scrolled through social media for hours just to feel connected to someone, anyone."},
    { "id": 3, "text": "Maya sighed as she closed Instagram, feeling more alone than before. Her fingers hovered over the keyboard, not sure what to search next. Suddenly, her computer screen flickered, the light pulsing strangely. The words \"Welcome to Alternis\" appeared in glowing blue letters. Maya leaned closer, confused. As she touched the screen to restart her computer, something impossible happened. Her fingertips didn't hit glass but sank through as if the screen was made of water. A tingling sensation spread up her arm. Before she could pull back, an invisible force tugged her forward. Maya tumbled headfirst through the screen with a startled yelp. She landed on soft grass instead of her bedroom floor. Looking up, Maya found herself in a beautiful forest clearing filled with flowers she had never seen before. In the center stood a simple pedestal with something shining on top - a delicate silver crown." },
    { "id": 4, "text": "Maya approached the pedestal cautiously, her footsteps silent on the soft grass. The silver crown sparkled with tiny blue gems that matched the color of the screen message. As she reached for it, a twig snapped behind her. Maya spun around to face someone who looked exactly like her—same height, same hair, same clothes—but with eyes that glowed like amber instead of her own brown ones. \"Don't touch that,\" her double warned, voice echoing strangely. \"The crown chooses its wearer.\" The doppelganger pointed to a tree where a strange helmet hung from a branch. Unlike the delicate crown, the helmet was made of dark metal with intricate patterns carved into its surface. \"That might suit you better,\" the double suggested with a smile that didn't reach her glowing eyes. \"The crown binds you here forever, but the helmet... the helmet shows you the way home.\"" },
    { "id": 5, "text": "Maya hesitated, her gaze shifting between the crown and the helmet. The word \"Alternis\" flashed in her mind—the strange message that had appeared on her computer screen before her fingers had slipped through it like jelly. \"Why should I trust you?\" she asked her double, taking a step backward. The doppelganger laughed, the sound rippling through the vibrant forest clearing. \"Because I was you once,\" she replied, \"before I chose the crown.\" As they spoke, a small fox with unusual silver markings appeared at the base of the tree. It scratched at the trunk with its paw, then looked directly at Maya with intelligent eyes. The animal seemed to be trying to tell her something important. When Maya glanced back at her double, she noticed something alarming—the edges of her copy's form were beginning to blur, as if she wasn't entirely solid." },
    { "id": 6, "text": "Maya reached out to touch her copy, but her hand passed right through. The copy smiled with those strange eyes—one blue, one green—unlike Maya's brown ones. \"Welcome to Alternis,\" the copy said, her voice echoing like it came from everywhere and nowhere. Maya looked around the forest clearing, noticing how the colors seemed too bright, the flowers too perfect. A soft melody drifted through the trees, and Maya followed the sound until she found a small silver harp resting against a stump. When she plucked a string, the air around her rippled like water. The copy appeared beside her again. \"The harp can help you return home,\" she explained, \"but first you must learn its song.\" Maya picked up the instrument, surprised by how light it felt. The copy was right—Maya needed to find her way back before she completely faded away in this strange world." },
    { "id": 7, "text": "Maya hesitated, then reached out to touch the doppelganger's outstretched hand. A spark jumped between them, and suddenly memories flooded back—her loneliness at school, her desire to be seen. \"There's another way,\" said a gentle voice. Maya turned to see an old woman holding a small blue potion. \"This will show you the truth.\" Maya drank it and gasped as the forest clearing shimmered. Her doppelganger wasn't another person but a reflection of who she could become if she believed in herself. The crown wasn't about ruling Alternis but about claiming her own confidence. Maya smiled as the world around her began to fade. She woke up at her desk, computer screen normal again. At school the next day, Maya spoke up in class, joined the art club, and introduced herself to new friends. She didn't need Alternis anymore—she had found her visibility in the real world by becoming her true self." }
