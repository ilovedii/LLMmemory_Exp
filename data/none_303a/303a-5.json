    { "id": 1, "text": "Jake stood frozen at the doorway of the robotics club, clutching his backpack straps so tightly his knuckles turned white. Twenty pairs of eyes stared back at him. The room buzzed with the sounds of small motors and student chatter that instantly died when he appeared. A tall girl with purple-streaked hair stepped forward. \"You lost?\" she asked, raising an eyebrow. Jake swallowed hard. He'd spent three weeks at Lincoln Middle School trying to be invisible, but his mom insisted he \"make friends\" and \"join something.\" He spotted familiar faces â€“ including Tyler from math class who had seemed nice until he started hanging out with the popular kids at lunch yesterday. Tyler quickly looked away, suddenly very interested in a pile of gears. Jake took a deep breath. \"Actually, I'm here to join. I built a drone last summer.\"" },
    { "id": 2, "text": "I built a drone last summer. It was a small quadcopter with blue LED lights that I assembled from a kit. When school started, I joined the robotics club to learn more about programming and mechanics. The teacher, Mr. Wilson, was impressed with my drone and asked me to demonstrate it for the club. During my presentation, a tall boy named Jake kept asking difficult questions about the flight controller. After the meeting, Jake approached me and admitted he was jealous because he had tried to build a drone but failed. I offered to help him fix his drone if he would teach me about the coding he knew. We agreed to meet on Saturday at the school workshop. Jake brought his broken drone in a shoebox, and together we identified the wiring problems. By lunchtime, we had both drones flying around the empty basketball court." },
    { "id": 3, "text": "Jared and I watched as our drones zoomed across the basketball court, dodging each other in mid-air. The blue one was mine, while Jared controlled the red one with expert precision. \"You're pretty good at this for a new kid,\" I said, impressed by how quickly he'd learned the controls. Jared smiled and showed me a trick where his drone did a complete flip. Just then, Mr. Rodriguez, our robotics teacher, walked in and clapped his hands. \"Excellent work, you two! But lunch period ends in five minutes.\" We guided our drones back to land safely on the court floor. As we packed up our equipment, Jared mentioned he had some ideas for upgrading the drones with small cameras. \"We could map the whole school from above,\" he suggested, and I nodded excitedly. This new friendship was definitely going to make robotics club more interesting." },
    { "id": 4, "text": "The next day, Alex arrived at robotics club early, excited to work with Jamie on their battle bot design. The classroom buzzed with activity as other students tinkered with circuit boards and motors. Jamie waved Alex over to a table covered with metal parts, wires, and tools. \"I brought some extra servos from home,\" Jamie said, pulling components from a backpack. They spent the hour sketching designs and arguing about the best way to build their robot's claw mechanism. When Mr. Peterson announced a surprise competition for next month, Alex and Jamie high-fived. Their robot would need to navigate an obstacle course and pick up small objects. Other teams looked worried, but Alex felt confident. With Jamie's programming skills and Alex's building experience, they had a good chance of winning. After club ended, they agreed to meet at the library tomorrow to research more design ideas." },
    { "id": 5, "text": "The next day, Mia arrived at the library early, excited to continue working on their robot design. She found a quiet corner with a large table and spread out her notebook filled with sketches. While waiting for her teammates, she browsed through some robotics magazines for inspiration. When Tyler and Jamal finally showed up, they brought snacks and their own ideas. The three middle schoolers spent hours comparing notes and searching online for examples of successful competition robots. Mia suggested adding a grabber arm that could pick up objects, while Tyler thought they should focus on speed. Jamal, who was good with programming, offered to work on the code if they could agree on a design. By the time the library was closing, they had a rough blueprint drawn and a list of materials they would need to start building at their next club meeting." },
    { "id": 6, "text": "As they packed up their materials, Jamie felt a surge of excitement about their robot design. The librarian flicked the lights, signaling it was time to leave. Outside, the autumn air felt cool as Jamie and the other Robotics Club members walked across the school courtyard. They discussed where to find the servo motors and circuit boards on their materials list. Mr. Peterson, their club advisor, overheard and mentioned he had some spare parts in the science lab they could use. Jamie, still new to the school, felt proud to be contributing ideas that the older students liked. Before splitting up to head home, they agreed to meet early before the next club meeting to organize everything. For the first time since moving to this town, Jamie felt like they belonged somewhere, and couldn't wait to start building their robot together." },
    { "id": 7, "text": "Jamie spent the next few weeks working on their robot with the club. They learned how to program motors, attach sensors, and build a sturdy frame. When competition day arrived, Jamie felt nervous but excited. Their robot, painted blue with a silver stripe, sat ready at the starting line. The challenge was to navigate an obstacle course and pick up small blocks. Jamie's robot moved slowly at first, but then smoothly completed each task. When it successfully grabbed the final block, everyone cheered. Jamie won third place and received a bronze medal. The club members patted Jamie's back and invited them for pizza to celebrate. Walking home later with the medal around their neck, Jamie smiled. This new town finally felt like home, and Jamie couldn't wait to start planning next year's even better robot design." }
