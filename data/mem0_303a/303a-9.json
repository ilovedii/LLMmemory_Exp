    { "id": 1, "text": "Mia stood outside the Art Room door, watching through the small window as the members of the Secret Handshake Club practiced their elaborate greeting rituals. Every Tuesday and Thursday, twelve kids gathered to create and perfect the most complicated handshakes Westlake Middle School had ever seen. Mia had been invited by her best friend Zach, who promised it was the coolest club in school. But as she watched them laughing and high-fiving, she hesitated. What if she messed up? What if they thought she was weird? Worse, what if joining this club meant her old friends from elementary school would stop talking to her? Zach spotted her through the window and waved enthusiastically. \"Come on in!\" he mouthed, gesturing to an empty chair beside him. Little did Mia know that someone in that room was about to make her first day at the club unforgettable—and not in a good way." },
    { "id": 2, "text": "Taking a deep breath, Mia pushed open the door and slipped inside. The room fell quiet as twelve pairs of eyes turned toward her. Zach jumped up, grinning. \"Everyone, this is Mia!\" he announced. A tall girl with braids named Jasmine stepped forward, demonstrating their welcome handshake. Mia tried to follow along but fumbled the final move. Someone snickered. \"Not everyone can handle our level,\" muttered Dylan, the club president. Mia's face burned with embarrassment until Ms. Garcia, the art teacher supervising the club, pulled a bright orange carrot from her lunch bag. \"Actually,\" she said, \"this reminds me of our next challenge. Partner handshakes inspired by vegetables!\" The room erupted in laughter and groans. Zach nudged Mia. \"Want to be partners? We could do something with that carrot as inspiration.\" Suddenly, the club didn't seem so intimidating anymore."},
    { "id": 3, "text": "Mia and Zach huddled in the corner of the art room, practicing their carrot-inspired handshake. They tapped fingers together like carrot tops, then made digging motions. \"That's perfect!\" Zach laughed. Across the room, Dylan watched with narrowed eyes while creating an elaborate routine with his partner. Ms. Garcia clapped her hands. \"Five minutes left to practice!\" she announced. Jasmine approached Mia with a bright red apple from her backpack. \"Here,\" she offered. \"Club tradition—new members get a welcome snack.\" Mia accepted it with surprise. \"Thanks!\" As she bit into the crisp fruit, Jasmine whispered, \"Don't worry about Dylan. He acted the same way when I joined last month.\" Mia felt relief wash over her. Maybe making new friends wouldn't mean losing her old ones. When it was their turn to perform, Mia and Zach nailed their handshake, earning cheers from everyone—even Dylan gave a reluctant nod of approval." },
    { "id": 4, "text": "After class, Mia spotted Dylan waiting by the water fountain. \"Hey,\" he said, shuffling his feet. \"Your handshake was pretty cool.\" Mia blinked in surprise as Dylan continued, \"I was worried you'd replace me as Zach's best friend. We've been partners since second grade.\" He pulled something from his backpack—a wooden ruler with intricate carvings. \"This is my lucky charm. Like a sword for protection. I call it my friendship defender.\" He laughed nervously. \"Sounds silly, right?\" Mia smiled, remembering how she'd watched the club from afar for weeks before Zach invited her to join. \"Not silly. I was scared too—about fitting in.\" Dylan's shoulders relaxed. \"The club meets Thursdays at lunch. We're working on a group handshake. Could use your carrot moves.\" He extended his hand, and Mia gave him their first high-five." },
    { "id": 5, "text": "Zach grinned as their hands connected. \"That's step one of our handshake,\" he explained, moving his fingers in a wiggling motion like a swimming fish. \"Now you try.\" Mia copied the movement, feeling silly but also excited. Around them, other club members performed their complex routines of fist bumps, finger snaps, and elbow touches. A tall girl with braids watched from across the circle, her eyes narrowed at Mia. \"That's Kendra,\" Zach whispered. \"She created most of our coolest moves.\" When Kendra approached, Mia smiled hopefully, but the older girl crossed her arms. \"Newbies practice basic moves for two weeks before joining our circle,\" she announced loudly. Everyone stopped to stare. Mia's cheeks burned hot as Kendra demonstrated an impossible-looking sequence ending with both hands forming fish mouths that opened and closed. \"Master this first,\" Kendra challenged with a smirk." },
    { "id": 6, "text": "Mia's eyes darted around the circle, searching for a friendly face. The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the schoolyard as the club members resumed their routines. She took a deep breath and turned to Zach. \"I'll practice every day until I get it right,\" she promised, determination replacing her embarrassment. The old clock tower chimed three times in the distance, making several club members check their watches. \"We've got fifteen minutes before the bus,\" Zach explained, showing Mia the first three moves again, slower this time. From her backpack, Mia pulled out a small notebook and quickly sketched the hand positions. Kendra noticed and raised an eyebrow, almost looking impressed despite herself. \"Smart,\" she muttered, then louder, \"Tomorrow at lunch, same place. Don't be late.\" Mia nodded, already planning to practice all evening until her fingers memorized every twist and turn." },
    { "id": 7, "text": "That evening, Mia sat cross-legged on her bedroom floor, fingers twisting and turning in the air. Her little brother laughed when he caught her practicing, but she didn't care. The next day at school, Mia spotted Zach by the Art Room. \"Ready?\" he asked with a smile. The club members formed a circle, and Mia's turn came. Her hands moved smoothly through each step until the final twist. She stumbled, and a girl named Tara snickered. But instead of giving up, Mia took a deep breath and tried again. This time, her fingers flowed perfectly. Zach cheered, and even Tara looked impressed. After school, Mia found a maple leaf on her desk with a note: \"Welcome to the club.\" She realized that new friendships didn't mean losing old ones—her heart had room for both, just like her hands had mastered new movements while remembering the old." }
