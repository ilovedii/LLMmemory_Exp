    { "id": 1, "text": "Jake stood frozen at the door of the drama club room, his stomach doing weird flips. It was his third week at Lincoln Middle School, and he still hadn't made any real friends. The drama teacher, Ms. Patel, had suggested he join after catching him doing impressions in the hallway. Through the door's window, he could see about fifteen kids laughing and tossing scripts around. A tall girl with bright blue hair was doing some kind of robot dance while others cheered her on. Jake took a deep breath and reached for the handle. Just then, his phone buzzed with a text from his old school friend Milo: \"Don't forget what happened last time you tried to be the funny guy.\" Jake's hand hesitated. Maybe putting himself out there wasn't worth the risk." },
    { "id": 2, "text": "Jake pushed the door open with a shaky hand. The blue-haired girl stopped mid-robot move and turned toward him. \"New kid alert!\" she announced, but her smile seemed friendly, not mocking. Ms. Patel appeared beside him and guided him into the room. \"Everyone, this is Jake. He does amazing impressions!\" The room fell silent as all eyes locked on him. Jake's throat went dry as he remembered Milo's warning text. Last year at his old school, he'd tried doing his principal impression at lunch and spilled chocolate milk all over himself. But before panic could fully set in, a short boy with glasses handed him a script. \"We need someone to play the talking carrot in our vegetable garden play,\" he explained. \"It's the funniest role, and Ms. Patel said you're hilarious.\" Jake took the script, surprised to find his hand wasn't shaking anymore."},
    { "id": 3, "text": "Jake flipped through the pages, his eyes widening at the lead role circled in red. Ms. Patel smiled encouragingly from across the room while the blue-haired girl continued her robot dance, now adding mechanical sound effects that made everyone laugh. Three weeks of eating lunch alone in the corner of the cafeteria had left Jake feeling invisible, but here in the drama club, people actually looked at him. A boy with glasses waved Jake over to an empty chair. \"I'm Zack. You're the new kid who does those awesome impressions in the hallway, right?\" Jake nodded, surprised someone had noticed. His phone buzzed—another text from Milo probably—but Jake slipped it back into his pocket without checking. On the table sat a bright red apple with a note attached: \"Props for today's improv exercise.\" Jake picked it up, an idea for his first scene already forming." },
    { "id": 4, "text": "Jake flipped through the script pages, imagining himself as a knight discovering a magical sword. The blue-haired girl he'd noticed before—Zoe was her name—walked over and peered at his work. \"That looks interesting,\" she said, pointing to his scribbled notes. Jake jumped, surprised anyone had noticed him after three weeks of feeling invisible in the drama club. \"It's just a scene about finding a sword,\" he mumbled, remembering Milo's text and how his last attempt at being funny had backfired at his old school. Zoe smiled and called over two other students. \"Guys, Jake has an awesome idea for the medieval showcase!\" Suddenly, everyone wanted to hear his concept. Ms. Patel clapped her hands excitedly when she overheard. \"Perfect timing! We needed a centerpiece for the showcase,\" she announced. Jake felt a warm flutter in his chest—maybe Lincoln Middle School wouldn't be so bad after all." },
    { "id": 5, "text": "Jake's heart raced as Ms. Patel handed him a notebook to develop his sword idea. During lunch break, he sat under the oak tree sketching scenes when Milo texted again: \"Remember your goldfish funeral play?\" Jake winced at the memory but kept working. Later in drama club, Zoe brought over a plastic fish prop from last year's ocean play. \"Maybe this could be magical too—like the sword transforms into a fish that grants wishes?\" she suggested. Two other students, Darius and Mei, joined them with costume ideas. \"We could use those blue streamers for water effects,\" Darius said. Jake nodded, surprised how easily they built on his concept. When the bell rang, Ms. Patel announced Jake would lead tomorrow's brainstorming session. Walking home, Jake realized something important—at Lincoln Middle School, his creativity wasn't something to hide anymore." },
    { "id": 6, "text": "Jake arrived at school early the next day, his notebook filled with sketches for the play. He spotted a dusty grandfather clock in the drama room corner that gave him an idea. \"What if the magical sword only works at certain times?\" he suggested when the group gathered. Darius clapped his hands. \"Like it has to be used before the clock strikes midnight!\" Mei added excitedly. During lunch, Jake noticed Milo had texted again, but he put his phone away without reading it. The afternoon brainstorming session went better than Jake expected. Ms. Patel brought in an actual prop sword from the storage room, and Zoe suggested they add tiny lights to make it glow. When the session ended, Jake stayed behind to help clean up. \"You're finding your place here,\" Ms. Patel said with a smile. For the first time in three weeks at Lincoln Middle School, Jake truly believed it." },
    { "id": 7, "text": "Jake stood in the doorway of the drama room, watching the blue-haired girl's robot dance make everyone laugh. Ms. Patel spotted him and waved him over with a warm smile. Despite Milo's text about his failed joke at his old school, Jake took a deep breath and stepped inside. The drama kids welcomed him immediately, asking about his impressions that Ms. Patel had mentioned. As weeks passed, Jake found his place in the club, even landing a small role in the fall play. On opening night, he spotted a familiar face in the audience—Milo had come to support him. After the show, Milo handed Jake a maple leaf bookmark. \"For turning over a new leaf,\" Milo explained with a grin. They laughed together, and Jake realized that middle school wasn't about avoiding embarrassment but finding where you belong. Lincoln Middle School had finally become home." }
