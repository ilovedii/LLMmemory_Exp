    { "id": 1, "text": "Mia stared at her computer screen as the clock hit midnight. She had been browsing random websites for hours, trying to avoid thinking about tomorrow—her first day at a new school. The screen suddenly flickered, and a strange website appeared with swirling colors and text that seemed to move. \"Enter if you dare,\" it read. Mia laughed and clicked the button, expecting some cheesy game. Instead, her room began to spin, and she felt herself being pulled forward. When everything stopped, Mia found herself standing in a forest with purple trees and a sky full of floating islands. A boy about her age approached, looking just as confused. \"Another new arrival,\" he said. \"I'm Leo. I've been stuck here for three days.\" He looked at her strangely. \"The weird thing is, when I checked my phone, I saw myself back home, going about my life like normal.\"" },
    { "id": 2, "text": "I stared at my phone in disbelief, watching myself move around my living room, picking up books and checking the mail. This couldn't be real. I had walked through the glowing doorway in the abandoned warehouse just ten minutes ago, and now I was somehow watching my own life through my phone screen. The warehouse around me was cold and dusty, completely different from my cozy apartment displayed on the screen. I touched the phone cautiously, and my finger went straight through the image, creating ripples like water. When I pulled my hand back, the screen showed my other self looking confused, touching the back of his neck as if feeling something strange. I realized with a shock that whatever I did here might affect my other self there. The portal hadn't just shown me another place - it had somehow connected me to another version of myself." },
    { "id": 3, "text": "I stared at my reflection in the glowing blue portal, but it wasn't quite me looking back. This other version wore glasses and had a scar above his left eyebrow. When I reached out, he did too, our fingertips touching through the strange doorway that had appeared in my bedroom wall last night. A weird tingling sensation shot up my arm, and suddenly I could hear his thoughts in my head. \"My name is Jake too,\" the other me said without speaking. \"But in my world, computers evolved differently.\" He showed me his smartphone, which looked like a small apple-shaped device that projected holograms. I pulled out my regular phone to compare, and he gasped. We spent hours trading stories about our different lives, our different friends, our different Earths. When Mom called me for dinner, I promised Other Jake I'd return tomorrow to learn more about his world." },
    { "id": 4, "text": "The next day, I rushed back to my computer after school, eager to talk with Other Jake again. I logged into the strange website we had discovered yesterday, and there he was, waiting for me. Other Jake waved through the screen, his room looking almost like mine but with weird posters of bands I'd never heard of. He showed me his collection of video games, which had similar titles to ones I knew but with different covers. We talked for hours about his world, where cars could fly and schools taught magic as a regular subject. Other Jake promised to introduce me to his friends tomorrow if I brought my laptop to the park. He said something about the portal working better outside. I agreed, curious about what would happen when more people from his world could see into mine." },
    { "id": 5, "text": "I watched as Mr. Jenkins set up his strange device on my kitchen table. He called it an \"Internet Portal,\" explaining that people from his world could now see into mine through their screens. At first, nothing seemed to happen, but then my phone buzzed with notifications. People I'd never met were commenting on my breakfast, my pajamas, even the way I organized my spice rack. Mr. Jenkins smiled proudly. \"It's working perfectly!\" he exclaimed. Soon, packages began arriving at my door—gifts from viewers who enjoyed watching my daily routine. Some sent useful items like cookbooks or gardening tools, while others mailed bizarre things like rubber chickens or glow-in-the-dark socks. The strangest part was stepping outside to find tourists taking selfies in front of my house. They waved excitedly when they saw me, as if I were a celebrity. My ordinary life had somehow become entertainment for an entire other world." },
    { "id": 6, "text": "I discovered this shocking truth when I found a strange glowing rectangle in my closet. It was a portal, showing people from another dimension watching me on screens. They called it \"The John Show,\" and my name wasn't even John! Every morning I woke up to find comments floating in the air about yesterday's \"episode.\" Some viewers loved when I tripped over my cat, while others complained when I studied too long. The worst part was when I tried to tell my parents - they couldn't see the comments or the portal at all. I started performing silly dances and telling jokes to my empty room, and the floating comments went wild with excitement. Soon I had fan clubs and merchandise in their world. I decided if I was going to be famous in another dimension, I might as well enjoy it. Besides, the portal people sometimes sent helpful advice about my math homework through the glowing rectangle." },
    { "id": 7, "text": "I found the portal people's math help super useful, especially when I struggled with fractions. One day, they sent a message saying they wanted to meet me in person. They told me to press a special button on my screen at exactly midnight. When I did, the glowing rectangle expanded into a doorway of light. Nervously, I stepped through and found myself in a room filled with friendly aliens who had been teaching me math all along. They explained they came from a planet where math was the universal language, and they'd chosen me to be their ambassador on Earth. After a fun evening learning cool space math, they sent me home with a small device to call them anytime I needed help. Now I'm getting straight A's in math, and sometimes when I look up at the stars, I wave, knowing my portal friends are watching over me." }
