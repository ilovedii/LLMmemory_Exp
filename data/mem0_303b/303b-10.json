    { "id": 1, "text": "Jake stood frozen at the doorway of the robotics club, clutching his backpack straps so tightly his knuckles turned white. Twenty pairs of eyes turned to stare at him. The room buzzed with the sounds of small motors and excited chatter that suddenly died down. A tall girl with curly hair approached him with a smile that seemed friendly enough. \"You must be Jake! I'm Priya, club president.\" She gestured around the crowded classroom filled with half-built robots and scattered tools. \"Everyone, this is the new transfer student I mentioned.\" A few kids waved while others whispered to each other. Jake spotted an empty seat next to a boy wearing a NASA t-shirt who rolled his eyes dramatically. \"You can sit by Marcus,\" Priya said, her smile faltering slightly. \"Just don't touch his project. Last person who did that... well, let's just say they don't come to robotics club anymore.\"" },
    { "id": 2, "text": "Jake's first day at robotics club started well enough. Priya, the club president with her bright smile, had welcomed him warmly and introduced him to everyone. \"And this is Marcus,\" she had said, pointing to a serious-looking boy in a NASA t-shirt who barely looked up from his complex robot design. \"You can sit next to him, but please don't touch his project. He's very particular.\" Jake had nodded nervously, clutching his backpack tighter as he took the empty seat. The room fell oddly quiet when he sat down, the earlier excitement fading into whispers. Jake tried to make conversation with Marcus, asking about the robot parts scattered across the table. That's when it happened - Jake accidentally knocked over Marcus's milk carton, sending white liquid cascading across the circuit boards. The electrical spark was small, but the damage was massive. And that's why Jake, the transfer student who lasted exactly forty-three minutes in robotics club, never returned." },
    { "id": 3, "text": "The aftermath of Jake's brief stint in robotics club became legendary among the members. Marcus sat quietly at his workbench, adjusting wires on his half-finished drone while still wearing his faded NASA t-shirt. \"I told him not to touch anything,\" he muttered to no one in particular. Priya, the club president, gathered everyone around to discuss the incident involving their would-be newest member. \"Look, we need to be more welcoming to newcomers,\" she said, placing a small 3D-printed crown on the tableâ€”their annual award for best innovation. \"Jake was nervous, but that doesn't excuse what happened to the circuit boards.\" The group nodded in agreement as they surveyed the charred remains of what had been three weeks of careful programming. Outside in the hallway, Jake hurried past the robotics room, clutching his backpack tightly, his face still red with embarrassment." },
    { "id": 4, "text": "Jake had never meant to touch Marcus's robot. He just wanted a closer look at the cool design with all those spinning gears. When his sleeve caught on the contraption, everything happened so fast. The robot arm swung wildly, knocking over a cup of soda that splashed across Marcus's NASA shirt. The entire club gasped. Priya rushed over, her face showing both concern and disappointment. \"This is exactly why I said not to touch other people's projects,\" she said firmly. Marcus stood up, his favorite shirt now stained brown, and Jake couldn't bear the angry looks from everyone. He mumbled an apology and backed away from the table of half-built robots and scattered tools. When Priya mentioned something about getting the safety HELMET for demonstrations next time, Jake took his chance to escape, slipping out the door before anyone could stop him." },
    { "id": 5, "text": "Jake ran all the way home, his face burning with shame. This was his first day at robotics club, and he'd already ruined everything. Priya had been so nice when she introduced him to everyone just forty-three minutes ago. She had even directed him to sit next to Marcus, who seemed like the smartest kid there. Jake threw his backpack on his bed and flopped down beside it. His phone buzzed with a text message. It was from an unknown number: \"Hey, it's Priya from robotics. Don't worry about today. Marcus's shirt will wash out. We have a project next week building robotic animal paws for a wildlife rescue. Could use your help if you're willing to try again.\" Jake stared at the message, surprised. Maybe he hadn't messed up everything after all. His fingers hovered over the phone as he considered his response." },
    { "id": 6, "text": "His fingers hovered over the phone as he considered his response. Jake had only lasted forty-three minutes in robotics club yesterday before the disaster with Marcus's project. The text from Priya, the club president, seemed genuine: \"We all make mistakes. Please come back tomorrow.\" Jake sighed, remembering how quickly the milk had spread across the table, shorting out the half-built robot Marcus had been working on for weeks. The other students had fallen silent as Marcus's face turned red with anger. Now, sitting alone in his bedroom at his new house, Jake wondered if he should give the club another chance. He typed \"OK\" and hit send before he could change his mind. Maybe tomorrow would be different. Maybe he could even help rebuild what he'd destroyed. After all, being a transfer student was hard enough without making enemies during his first week." },
    { "id": 7, "text": "Jake entered the robotics club with high hopes, but things went downhill fast. When Priya, the club president, introduced him to everyone, she directed him to sit next to Marcus, who was working on a complex robot arm. \"Don't touch Marcus's project,\" Priya warned with a serious look. Jake nodded, carefully setting his backpack down. The room buzzed with activity, filled with half-built robots and tools scattered across tables. While reaching for his notebook, Jake's elbow knocked over Marcus's milk carton, sending white liquid splashing across the circuit board. Marcus jumped up, face red with anger. \"You ruined weeks of work!\" he shouted. Despite Jake's apologies, the damage was done. Jake lasted exactly forty-three minutes in robotics club before walking out, face burning with embarrassment. He never returned to robotics club, but instead found his place in the school's art program, where his creative talents truly belonged. After all, being a transfer student was hard enough without making enemies during his first week." }
