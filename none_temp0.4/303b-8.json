    { "id": 1, "text": "Jake fidgeted with his backpack straps as he stood outside the robotics club door. Through the small window, he could see kids laughing while tinkering with metal parts and wires. His old school didn't have cool clubs like this. Starting at a new school in the middle of eighth grade was hard enough, but his mom insisted he \"put himself out there\" and \"make friends.\" Easy for her to say. He took a deep breath and pushed the door open. Twenty heads turned his way. \"Um, hi,\" Jake mumbled. \"I'm new.\" A tall girl with curly hair waved him over. \"Perfect timing! We need someone for our team. I'm Zoe.\" She pointed to a boy wearing a NASA t-shirt who barely looked up from his circuit board. \"That's Marcus. Don't mind his attitude. He thinks new people slow us down before the competition.\"" },
    { "id": 2, "text": "Javier stood at the entrance of the robotics lab, watching the team work on their competition robot. The club president, Marcus, glared at him from across the room. He thinks new people slow us down before the competition. Javier took a deep breath and walked toward the group anyway. Marcus rolled his eyes and continued adjusting gears on the robot arm. \"I know how to program that servo motor,\" Javier said quietly, pointing to the part Marcus was struggling with. The president looked surprised but moved aside reluctantly. Javier typed code quickly, and the robot arm suddenly moved smoothly. The other club members watched with wide eyes as Javier fixed three more problems in just ten minutes. Marcus's frown slowly changed to a small smile. \"Maybe you can help us win after all,\" he admitted, offering Javier the team t-shirt. \"Welcome to Robotics Club.\"" },
    { "id": 3, "text": "The new kid, Alex, walked into the robotics club room, feeling nervous but excited. The teacher, Mr. Johnson, smiled and said, \"Welcome to Robotics Club.\" Alex noticed several students working on different projects at tables around the room. Some were building small cars with motors, while others programmed computers connected to mechanical arms. A tall girl with curly hair waved Alex over to her table where parts were scattered everywhere. \"I'm Mia,\" she said, handing Alex a small screwdriver. \"We're building a robot that can follow a line on the floor.\" Alex sat down and carefully picked up a small motor, examining how it connected to the wheels. Mr. Johnson came over and placed a shiny metal part on their table. \"This might help your design,\" he suggested. Alex smiled, already feeling more comfortable in this new club." },
    { "id": 4, "text": "Alex smiled, already feeling more comfortable in this new club. The robotics room buzzed with activity as students worked on different projects. Mr. Chen, the club advisor, walked over and handed Alex a small kit with wires, motors, and plastic parts. \"This is your starter set. Today we're building simple robots that can follow a line,\" he explained. Alex opened the box and carefully laid out all the pieces on the workbench. A girl with curly hair at the next table leaned over. \"Need any help? I'm Jasmine. I've been in robotics club for two years now.\" Alex nodded gratefully as Jasmine showed how to connect the motor to the battery pack. Within an hour, Alex had assembled a small robot that actually moved when switched on, making it wobble across the table while everyone clapped." },
    { "id": 5, "text": "The other students in robotics club stared in amazement as Alex's robot continued to move around the table. Mr. Peterson, the club advisor, walked over with a smile and patted Alex on the shoulder. \"Impressive work for your first day,\" he said. Alex beamed with pride while adjusting a loose wire on the robot's side. The small machine now moved in a straighter line instead of wobbling. Encouraged by this success, Alex grabbed more parts from the supply bin and started sketching plans for a robotic arm attachment. Two other students, Maya and Tyler, scooted their chairs closer to watch and learn. They asked questions about how the motor worked and where Alex had learned to build robots. By the end of the club meeting, the three of them had formed a team and were planning to enter the upcoming school science fair together." },
    { "id": 6, "text": "The next day, Mia, Jayden, and Tyler met in the cafeteria to discuss their robotics project. They spread out notebooks and sketched designs for a trash-collecting robot that could help clean the school grounds. Mia suggested using recycled materials to build the base, while Jayden knew how to program the movement controls. Tyler, the new kid who had just joined the robotics club last week, surprised everyone with his knowledge of sensors that could detect different types of trash. Their science teacher, Ms. Garcia, walked by and smiled at their enthusiasm. She offered them extra lab time after school on Thursdays to work on their project. The team high-fived each other, excited about their chances of winning first place. Tyler felt happy for the first time since moving to this new school." },
    { "id": 7, "text": "Tyler felt happy for the first time since moving to this new school. The robotics club welcomed him with open arms when they saw his skills with circuit boards. Mr. Peterson, the club advisor, gave Tyler special parts to build his own robot for the upcoming competition. During lunch breaks, Tyler worked hard on his creation while other club members watched in amazement. On competition day, Tyler's robot performed perfectly, completing all tasks faster than any other team's. The crowd cheered as the judges awarded Tyler's team first place. His new friends lifted him onto their shoulders in celebration. That evening, Tyler's parents surprised him with a cake decorated like a robot to celebrate his victory. As Tyler blew out the candles, he knew he had finally found where he belonged. This new school wasn't so bad after all." }
