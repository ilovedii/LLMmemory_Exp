    { "id": 1, "text": "Jake stood frozen at the door of the drama club room, his heart pounding. Twenty pairs of eyes turned to stare at him. Being the new kid at Westlake Middle School was hard enough, but joining a club where everyone already knew each other felt impossible. \"Um, is this where drama club meets?\" he asked, his voice cracking. A tall girl with bright blue hair burst out laughing. \"No, this is where we plan world domination. Of course it's drama club!\" The room erupted in giggles, but then a boy with glasses waved him over. \"Ignore Zoe. She thinks she's hilarious. I'm Mateo.\" Jake smiled with relief as he took a seat. Maybe he could make friends here after all. What Jake didn't notice was the whispered conversation between two students in the back, or the way they kept glancing his way with mischievous grins." },
    { "id": 2, "text": "After drama club ended, Jake gathered his backpack and script, ready to head home. The two students from the back, Mia and Tyler, approached him with those same grins. \"Hey, new kid,\" Mia said, \"we need someone to help with our secret project.\" Tyler nodded eagerly. \"We're planning a surprise performance for Ms. Wilson's birthday next week, but we need more people.\" Jake hesitated, unsure if this was a trick or a genuine invitation. The drama room suddenly felt quieter as other students left. A colorful poster about teamwork hung on the wall behind them. \"It'll be fun, promise,\" Mia added, holding out a small notebook with ideas scribbled inside. \"We meet tomorrow during lunch in the music room.\" Jake smiled slowly, deciding that maybe making friends in drama club wouldn't be so hard after all." },
    { "id": 3, "text": "Jake walked into the drama club room the next day with more confidence. He waved at the group of students who were already setting up chairs for the meeting. The drama teacher, Ms. Garcia, clapped her hands to get everyone's attention and announced they would be doing tryouts for the spring musical. Jake's stomach fluttered with nerves, but he raised his hand when she asked who wanted to audition. During his turn, Jake sang a short song and read some lines from the script. His voice shook at first, but grew stronger as he continued. After tryouts, three students came up to Jake and invited him to join them for lunch tomorrow. One girl even complimented his singing voice. Jake nodded happily, feeling like he had found his place at the new school." },
    { "id": 4, "text": "Jake walked into the drama club meeting the next day with a big smile. The other students greeted him warmly as he took a seat in the circle. Ms. Peterson, the drama teacher, announced they would be performing \"Romeo and Juliet\" for the spring play. When she asked for volunteers to read parts, Jake raised his hand even though he felt nervous. He stumbled over some words while reading Romeo's lines, but everyone clapped when he finished. After practice, two students named Mia and Tyler invited Jake to join them for lunch tomorrow. They talked about costumes and stage design as they walked through the hallway. Jake couldn't believe how quickly he was making friends here. Before heading home, he wrote his name on the sign-up sheet for auditions next week, hoping he might get a real part in the play." },
    { "id": 5, "text": "The next day, Jake arrived at the auditorium fifteen minutes early for drama club tryouts. He sat nervously in the back row, watching other students practice their lines. When Ms. Rodriguez called his name, Jake walked to the center of the stage with shaky legs. He took a deep breath and performed the monologue he had practiced all night. His voice started quiet but grew stronger with each sentence. The drama teacher smiled and nodded as he finished. Two other students clapped, which made Jake's face turn red. Ms. Rodriguez wrote something on her clipboard and told Jake the cast list would be posted Friday. As he left the auditorium, a tall girl with curly hair introduced herself as Mia, the stage manager. She said she liked his audition and hoped he would join their drama family." },
    { "id": 6, "text": "Jake smiled at Ms. Thompson, the drama teacher, feeling proud that his audition went well. He had been nervous about trying out for the school play, but now he felt excited to be part of the drama club. The next day, Jake arrived at the theater room for his first official meeting. He saw a group of students sitting in a circle on the stage, laughing and talking. A tall girl with curly hair waved him over. \"I'm Sophia, the club president,\" she said. \"Come join us!\" Jake sat down between Sophia and a boy wearing a bright yellow hat. They were discussing their upcoming production of \"The Wizard of Oz.\" Jake listened carefully as Ms. Thompson handed out scripts and explained everyone's roles. He had been cast as the Scarecrow, a bigger part than he expected. Maybe this new school wouldn't be so bad after all." },
    { "id": 7, "text": "Jenna walked into the drama club meeting, her heart racing with excitement. The room buzzed with students practicing lines and laughing together. Ms. Peterson, the drama teacher, welcomed Jenna with a warm smile and introduced her to everyone. The other kids immediately invited her to join their circle, asking about her previous acting experience. During their first exercise, Jenna impressed everyone with her confident performance of a short monologue. At lunch, she sat with her new drama friends, who shared stories about past productions and upcoming auditions. When tryouts for the spring musical were announced, Jenna signed up without hesitation. Two weeks later, the cast list was posted, and there was her name next to the lead role! On opening night, as the curtain fell and the audience applauded, Jenna knew she had found her place. This new school wasn't just \"not so bad\" - it was exactly where she belonged." }
