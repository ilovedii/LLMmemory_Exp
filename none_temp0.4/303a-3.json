    { "id": 1, "text": "Jake stood frozen at the doorway of the robotics club, clutching his backpack straps so tightly his knuckles turned white. Twenty pairs of eyes turned to stare at him. Some curious, some bored, some already dismissive. The room buzzed with activity – kids huddled around half-built robots, circuit boards, and tangled wires. A tall girl with bright blue hair waved him over. \"Hey! You must be Jake. I'm Zoe, club president.\" She grinned and pointed to an empty seat. \"We need someone who knows coding. Do you?\" Jake nodded, relief washing over him. Maybe he'd finally found his people. As he sat down, a boy with glasses whispered to another student, \"Five bucks says the new kid quits by Friday.\" Jake pretended not to hear, but the words stung. He'd switched schools three times already this year. Making friends shouldn't be this hard." },
    { "id": 2, "text": "Making friends shouldn't be this hard. Alex stood at the doorway of the robotics club, watching other kids tinker with circuit boards and motors. Everyone seemed to already know each other, laughing and sharing tools without even asking. The room smelled like solder and plastic, with bright fluorescent lights shining on workbenches covered with half-built robots. Alex took a deep breath and walked toward an empty seat, accidentally bumping into a table and knocking over a box of screws. The metallic pieces scattered across the floor with a loud clatter. Everyone turned to stare. Alex's face burned with embarrassment while scrambling to pick up the mess. Surprisingly, a girl with curly hair and glasses knelt down to help. \"I'm Maya,\" she said with a smile, handing Alex a handful of screws. \"First day is always tough. Want to help me build my battle bot?\"" },
    { "id": 3, "text": "\"Want to help me build my battle bot?\" asked Mia, a girl with bright red hair and safety goggles perched on her head. She stood next to a half-assembled robot on the workbench in the school's robotics lab. Jake, the new kid who had just transferred last week, looked up from his notebook with surprise. Nobody had invited him to join anything since he arrived. The robotics club room buzzed with activity as other students worked on their projects, soldering wires and programming code. Jake nodded eagerly and walked over to Mia's station, where parts were organized in small plastic bins. She handed him a screwdriver and pointed to a diagram on her tablet. \"We need to attach these motor mounts before Friday's competition,\" Mia explained, showing him where each piece should go. Jake smiled, feeling like he might finally belong somewhere at this new school." },
    { "id": 4, "text": "Jake walked into the robotics club room, his backpack slung over one shoulder. The other kids were already working on their projects, some building small robots with wheels, others coding on laptops. A tall teacher with glasses waved him over. \"You must be Jake! Welcome to Robotics Club,\" she said. \"I'm Ms. Chen.\" She showed him to an empty table where parts were organized in clear bins. Two students nearby looked up and introduced themselves as Mia and Tyler. They were working on a robot that could follow a line on the floor. Jake sat down next to them, and Mia pushed a box of parts toward him. \"Want to help us? We need someone to build the sensor mount,\" she offered. Jake nodded eagerly and picked up the instruction sheet, his fingers already reaching for the plastic pieces and tiny screws." },
    { "id": 5, "text": "Jake spread the robot parts across the table, carefully sorting them by size and type. The other kids in the robotics club were already halfway done with their projects, but Jake didn't mind being behind. This was his first day at Westfield Middle School, and the robotics club seemed like the perfect place to make friends. Mr. Peterson, the club supervisor, walked over and pointed at a small motor in the pile. \"That's your power source,\" he explained, showing Jake how to connect the wires. Two students from across the room, Mia and Tyler, noticed Jake struggling with a tricky gear connection and came over to help. \"It took me three tries to get that part right,\" Mia said with a friendly smile. Jake thanked them and felt a little less nervous about being the new kid." },
    { "id": 6, "text": "Jake joined the other students at the robotics club table, where they were building small machines with colorful parts. Ms. Chen, the club teacher, handed him a starter kit and explained the day's challenge: to create a robot that could move across the table without falling off. Jake carefully examined the pieces, connecting wires and gears like the instruction sheet showed. The other kids seemed to know what they were doing, especially a girl named Mia who had already built half her robot. When Jake's motor wouldn't work, Mia scooted her chair over and pointed out that he had connected the battery backward. \"Happens to everyone,\" she said with a smile. Jake fixed the connection, and his robot's wheels started spinning. By the end of the meeting, his robot wasn't the fastest, but it successfully crossed the table without falling, and everyone clapped." },
    { "id": 7, "text": "After the meeting, Miguel packed up his robot with a big smile. Mr. Chen, the robotics teacher, walked over and patted him on the shoulder. \"Nice job today! You've got real potential,\" he said. The other kids invited Miguel to sit with them at lunch tomorrow, and Sophia even asked if he wanted to work together on the next project. As Miguel walked home, he spotted a maple leaf swirling down from a tree. He caught it mid-air and tucked it into his notebook for good luck. That evening, he called his grandmother to tell her all about his successful day. Miguel fell asleep that night feeling like he finally belonged somewhere. The robot parts on his desk gleamed in the moonlight, ready for whatever challenge came next. Robotics Club wasn't just about machines anymore—it was where Miguel had found his people." }
