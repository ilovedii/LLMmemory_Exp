    { "id": 1, "text": "Jake stood frozen in the doorway of the robotics club, clutching his backpack straps so tightly his knuckles turned white. Twenty pairs of eyes stared back at him. The room buzzed with the sounds of small motors and excited chatter that instantly died when he appeared. A tall girl with bright blue hair stepped forward. \"You lost?\" she asked, raising an eyebrow. Jake swallowed hard. His mom had insisted joining a club would help him make friends at his new school. \"I'm Jake. I signed up yesterday,\" he mumbled. Someone snickered in the back. The blue-haired girl's face suddenly broke into a wide grin. \"Perfect timing! We need someone for our competition team. I'm Zoe.\" She grabbed his arm and pulled him toward a table covered in robot parts. \"Just don't mess with Marcus's stuff. Last kid who did that found his locker filled with mechanical spiders.\"" },
    { "id": 2, "text": "Jake gulped and took a small step backward, wondering if he should just leave before the same fate awaited him. The tall boy in the center of the room, wearing safety goggles pushed up on his forehead, broke into a wide grin. \"That was just a joke we played on Tyler because he pranked us first,\" he explained, walking toward Jake with an outstretched hand. \"I'm Marcus, club president. We actually need someone who knows coding.\" Jake relaxed his grip on his backpack and shook Marcus's hand. The tension in the room disappeared as the other students returned to their projects, the whir of small motors and clicking of keyboard keys filling the air. A girl with curly hair waved him over to an empty seat beside a half-built robot that looked like it needed serious help. Maybe this club wouldn't be so bad after all."},
    { "id": 3, "text": "Jake took a deep breath and stepped further into the robotics club room. The other students made space for him at one of the workbenches where parts of robots were scattered across the surface. A girl with curly hair and glasses waved him over. \"I'm Mia,\" she said, pointing to an empty chair. \"We're building a robot that can sort different colored blocks.\" Jake set his backpack down and picked up a small motor, turning it over in his hands. The teacher, Mr. Chen, walked over and showed Jake how to connect wires to the motor. When Jake successfully made the motor spin, several students clapped. Mia handed him an APPLE-sized battery pack that would power their creation. Jake smiled as he carefully attached it to their robot's frame. The nervous feeling in his stomach was replaced with excitement as he became part of the team." },
    { "id": 4, "text": "Jake's excitement grew as the robotics club members welcomed him with friendly smiles and curious questions about his previous experience. The team leader, a tall girl with glasses named Mia, showed him around the workshop where various robot parts and tools covered the tables. Jake noticed a metallic robot arm that moved like a SWORD slicing through air when one student pressed a button on their laptop. The club was working on a battle robot for the upcoming competition, and they needed someone with good programming skills. When Jake mentioned he had been coding since fourth grade, everyone cheered. For the first time since moving to this new school, Jake felt like he belonged somewhere. He sat down at an empty workstation, opened his laptop, and joined the others in programming their robot, his earlier nervousness completely forgotten as he became absorbed in the exciting project." },
    { "id": 5, "text": "Jake's fingers flew across the keyboard, his code taking shape faster than he expected. The robot on his workstation began to respond to his commands, its small mechanical arms moving smoothly as it picked up a small block. Around him, the other students were deep in their own work, but occasionally glanced over at his screen with impressed looks. Mr. Peterson, the club advisor, walked by and nodded approvingly at Jake's progress. \"Nice work for your first day,\" he said with a smile. Jake couldn't help but grin back, feeling a sense of belonging wash over him. When the robot successfully completed the obstacle course they had set up on the table, a few of his new clubmates gave him high-fives. By the end of the meeting, Jake had already been invited to join their team for the upcoming robotics competition." },
    { "id": 6, "text": "Jake couldn't believe his luck as he walked home from school, a smile spreading across his face. The robotics club members had welcomed him with open arms, especially after they saw how quickly he fixed the broken sensor on their main project. The team captain, a tall girl named Mia, had even given him a special notebook to record his ideas for the competition. Jake glanced at the school CLOCK as he passed by the main entrance, realizing he had spent three hours in the club without noticing the time. His mom would be wondering where he was, but he knew she'd be happy he had found something he enjoyed at his new school. Tomorrow, he would return with his own tools and the circuit board he had been working on at home. For the first time since moving to this town, Jake felt like he belonged somewhere." },
    { "id": 7, "text": "For the first time since moving to this town, Jake felt like he belonged somewhere. The robotics club members welcomed him with smiles and questions about his previous experience building machines. Ms. Chen, the club advisor, showed Jake around the workshop filled with tools, wires, and half-finished robots. A small plant in a pot sat on the windowsill, its green leaves catching the afternoon sunlight. Jake noticed how everyone worked together, helping each other solve problems. By the end of the meeting, he had helped program a small robot to follow a line across the floor. When it successfully completed the course, everyone cheered. As Jake packed up his things, several students invited him to sit with them at lunch tomorrow. Walking home, Jake smiled, already planning what improvements he could suggest at the next meeting. He wasn't the new kid anymoreâ€”he was just Jake from robotics club." }
