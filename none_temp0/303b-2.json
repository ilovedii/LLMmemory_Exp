    { "id": 1, "text": "Jake stood frozen at the doorway of the robotics club, clutching his backpack straps so tightly his knuckles turned white. Twenty pairs of eyes stared back at him. Some curious, some bored, some already dismissive. The club president, a tall girl with bright blue hair, waved him over. \"You must be Jake! Come in, we don't bite.\" A few students laughed. Jake shuffled forward, nearly tripping over a stray robot wheel. More laughter. He spotted an empty seat next to a boy who was busy tinkering with what looked like a small metal arm. The boy glanced up, grinned, and scooted over to make room. \"I'm Theo. Your timing is perfectâ€”we need someone for the programming team.\" Jake smiled back, relief washing over him. Maybe he could find his people here. What Jake didn't know was that Theo had his own reasons for being so welcoming." },
    { "id": 2, "text": "Theo had been the club's president for two years, but membership was dropping. The school principal had warned him that without more members, the robotics club might get canceled next semester. Jake looked like a perfect addition - his science fair project last month had won first place, and Theo had noticed how carefully Jake had built his volcano model. \"Come sit with us,\" Theo said, pointing to an empty chair next to a half-built robot. \"We're working on a battle bot for the district competition.\" Jake slowly walked over, his shoulders relaxing a little. The robot on the table had wires sticking out everywhere and a small container attached to its side. \"What's that for?\" Jake asked, pointing to the container. Theo grinned. \"That's where we store extra battery power. We were thinking of adding a second one for more juice during competitions.\""},
    { "id": 3, "text": "Jake nodded, trying to look like he understood what they meant about adding a second battery. \"That makes sense,\" he said, even though it didn't to him yet. The club president, a tall girl with glasses, waved him over to an empty seat at the workbench. As Jake walked over, he noticed a small robot in the center of the table. It had wheels, sensors, and what looked like a metal arm on top. Some of the other students were adding wires and small parts to similar robots. One boy was even testing a robot that had something that looked like a CROWN made of aluminum foil on top. Jake set his backpack down and took a seat, feeling less nervous now. Maybe this robotics club wouldn't be so bad after all. He watched carefully as the president began explaining their current project and what parts they would need for the competition next month." },
    { "id": 4, "text": "Jake listened closely, his eyes darting between the president and the complex robot diagrams on the whiteboard. The club was working on a rescue robot that could navigate through small spaces during emergencies. When the president mentioned they needed someone to design a protective covering for the robot's sensors, Jake slowly raised his hand. \"Maybe we could create something like a helmet to shield the important parts,\" he suggested, his voice barely audible. A few students nodded in agreement while others whispered among themselves. Jake's shoulders relaxed slightly as the club president smiled and wrote his idea on the board. For the first time since entering the room, Jake loosened his grip on his backpack straps and took a small step forward, away from the safety of the doorway and toward the table where other students were already sketching designs." },
    { "id": 5, "text": "Jake moved toward the table with small, careful steps, like he was walking on ice that might crack. The other students made space for him without saying anything. A tall girl with curly hair slid a blank paper his way. Jake sat down and pulled out his pencil case, which had a small robot keychain dangling from the zipper. He noticed the designs around him - some simple, others complicated with gears and circuits drawn in detail. The robotics teacher, Mr. Chen, walked over and placed a friendly hand on Jake's shoulder. \"Welcome to Robotics Club. We're building helper robots this semester,\" he explained, pointing to a shelf where small metal frames sat waiting. Jake nodded and began sketching his own design, his pencil moving faster as his nervousness faded. When he looked up again, the tall girl was watching his drawing with interest." },
    { "id": 6, "text": "\"Is that a drone design?\" the tall girl asked, pointing at Jake's notebook. Jake nodded, his grip on his backpack loosening slightly. The girl introduced herself as Maya, the club president. \"We're working on a competition robot that needs to navigate an obstacle course,\" she explained, leading him toward a table covered with metal parts and wires. Other students began to gather around, their initial stares turning to curious glances at Jake's detailed sketches. Maya showed him their half-built robot, which reminded Jake of the HARP instrument his grandmother played - all strings and delicate connections. \"We could use someone with your design skills,\" Maya said, clearing a space for him at the workbench. Jake set down his backpack and picked up a screwdriver, a small smile forming as the other students started asking questions about his ideas." },
    { "id": 7, "text": "Jake's fingers worked quickly, explaining his design for a robot that could sort recycling as he tightened screws. The other students nodded with interest, especially when he showed them his sketches. \"That's actually really cool,\" said Mia, the club president. Over the next hour, Jake helped fix a motor problem that had stumped the team for weeks. By the end of the meeting, he was laughing and sharing snacks with his new friends. When the bell rang, Mr. Chen, the robotics teacher, patted Jake's shoulder. \"We meet every Tuesday and Thursday. Will we see you tomorrow?\" Jake looked around at the smiling faces and the half-built robots scattered across the tables. For the first time since moving to this school, he felt like he belonged somewhere. \"Definitely,\" Jake answered, already planning improvements for their competition robot as he walked out the door." }
