    { "id": 1, "text": "Jake stood frozen in the doorway of the robotics club, clutching his backpack straps so tightly his knuckles turned white. Twenty pairs of eyes stared back at him. The room buzzed with the sounds of small motors and excited chatter that instantly died when he appeared. A tall girl with bright blue hair stepped forward. \"You lost?\" she asked, raising an eyebrow. Jake swallowed hard. After three schools in two years, he knew the drill – lay low, don't stand out, find one decent person to sit with at lunch. But something about this school made him want to try differently. \"Actually, I signed up yesterday,\" he managed to say. The girl's serious expression cracked into a smile. \"Cool! We need someone who can program the navigation system.\" Jake relaxed slightly, not noticing the whispers between two boys in the corner, pointing at him and snickering." },
    { "id": 2, "text": "Jake relaxed slightly, not noticing the whispers between two boys in the corner, pointing at him and snickering. The robotics club room buzzed with activity as students tinkered with metal parts and circuit boards. A tall girl with curly hair waved Jake over to an empty seat at her table. \"I'm Mia, team captain,\" she said with a friendly smile. \"We need someone to help with programming our new robot.\" Jake nodded and set his backpack down, pulling out his notebook. The two boys from the corner walked by, bumping his table on purpose. Parts scattered across the floor, including a small orange component that reminded Jake of a carrot. Jake quickly bent down to gather the fallen pieces, his face turning red. Mia shot the boys a stern look before helping Jake collect the parts. \"Don't mind them,\" she whispered. \"They act tough, but wait until they see what you can do.\""},
    { "id": 3, "text": "Jake took a deep breath and stepped into the robotics club room. The other students watched him closely as he made his way to an empty table. He set down his backpack and pulled out a small metal box. With careful movements, Jake opened the box to reveal a tiny robot he had built at home. It had blinking lights and could move in all directions. When he switched it on, the robot rolled across the table, did a perfect spin, and then beeped a friendly hello. The room fell silent for a moment before erupting in excited chatter. A tall boy with glasses rushed over. \"That's so cool! How did you program it?\" he asked. Jake smiled for the first time since entering the room. Maybe this wouldn't be so bad after all. The robotics teacher clapped her hands and announced, \"Looks like we have some real talent joining us today!\"" },
    { "id": 4, "text": "Jake's face turned red as the robotics teacher's words hung in the air. He shuffled toward an empty seat, nearly tripping over a toolbox on the floor. The classroom buzzed with the sounds of small motors and clicking keyboards. A tall boy with glasses waved Jake over to his table where a half-built robot sat surrounded by wires and metal parts. \"I'm Theo,\" the boy said, pointing to an empty chair. \"We're building a battle robot with extendable arms.\" Jake noticed a small metal rod sticking out from the robot that looked sharp like a sword. His nervousness began to fade as Theo explained their project. The other students returned to their work, no longer staring at him. Jake set his backpack down and picked up a screwdriver, ready to prove the teacher right about his talent." },
    { "id": 5, "text": "With shaky hands, Jake turned the screwdriver, carefully attaching a metal arm to the small robot frame on the table. The other students watched as he worked, some whispering to each other. Mr. Peterson, the club teacher, nodded approvingly from across the room. Jake remembered how his old science teacher had recommended him for the robotics club, saying he had natural talent with machines. The robot parts clicked together perfectly as Jake continued working. A girl with curly hair moved closer to see what he was doing. \"That's really good,\" she said, pointing to his neat wiring job. Jake smiled for the first time since entering the room. Maybe this club wouldn't be so bad after all. He reached for another piece, feeling more confident with each turn of the screwdriver." },
    { "id": 6, "text": "The small motor whirred to life under Jake's careful adjustments, making the robot's arm move smoothly across the table. A smile spread across his face as other club members gathered around, nodding with approval. \"Nice work for your first day,\" said Emma, the club president, giving him a thumbs-up. Jake glanced at the wall clock, surprised to see two hours had passed so quickly. As the meeting ended, several students patted his back and invited him to sit with them at lunch tomorrow. Walking home that afternoon, Jake felt the weight of his first-day nerves completely gone. His robot might not have been the fanciest in the club, but it worked—and more importantly, he'd found where he belonged. The robotics club wasn't just about building machines; it was about building friendships, and Jake couldn't wait to return." },
    { "id": 7, "text": "As he zipped his backpack closed, Jake looked around the robotics lab one last time before heading home. The afternoon sunlight streamed through the windows, catching the metal parts scattered across workbenches. Mr. Wilson gave him a thumbs-up from across the room while Emma and Tyler waved goodbye. Jake smiled, remembering how nervous he'd been just weeks ago. Now the robot they'd built together sat proudly on the display shelf, its first-place ribbon hanging beside it. Outside, autumn leaves danced across the school courtyard as Jake walked toward the bus stop. He pulled out his phone and added a reminder about tomorrow's meeting, already thinking about their next project. The fear he'd felt standing in that doorway seemed so distant now. Jake had found his people, his passion, and a future filled with possibilities—all because he'd been brave enough to step through that door." }
