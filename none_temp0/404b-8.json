    { "id": 1, "text": "Mia froze at the entrance to the school gym, watching the other eighth graders practicing their routines for the upcoming dance competition. Everyone seemed to have a partner except her. She spotted Tyler, the new boy who'd moved here last month, sitting alone on the bleachers. He was tall with curly hair and seemed nice enough, but they'd barely spoken. Coach Martinez clapped her hands. \"Remember, you need a partner by Friday or you can't compete!\" Mia took a deep breath and walked over to Tyler. \"Hey, I need a dance partner and you look partnerless too. Want to team up?\" Tyler looked surprised but nodded. \"Sure, but I should warn youâ€”I'm terrible at dancing.\" Mia smiled. \"That's okay. We can practice.\" What she didn't mention was her plan to make her ex-friend Olivia jealous by pretending she and Tyler were more than just dance partners." },
    { "id": 2, "text": "Tyler raised his eyebrows when Mia suggested they practice extra hours after school. \"So you just want to win the competition, right?\" he asked, looking at her closely. Mia nodded quickly, avoiding his eyes. She didn't tell him about wanting to make Olivia notice them. Every afternoon that week, they met in the empty gym, working on their steps until their feet hurt. Tyler was actually a good dancer, and Mia found herself laughing more than she expected. On Thursday, when they finally got their spin move perfect, Tyler high-fived her and said, \"We might actually have a chance at winning this thing!\" Mia smiled but glanced across the gym where Olivia was entering with her partner. Perfect timing. Mia grabbed Tyler's hand and leaned in close, pretending to whisper something important. From the corner of her eye, she saw Olivia watching them, her mouth forming a small \"o\" of surprise."},
    { "id": 3, "text": "Mia quickly turned away, not wanting Olivia to see her staring at the other dancers. The gym buzzed with activity as pairs counted steps and practiced spins under the colorful streamers hanging from the ceiling. Music echoed against the walls while Coach Martinez clapped her hands to keep everyone on beat. Mia shuffled toward the bleachers, clutching her dance notebook tightly against her chest. She had spent weeks designing routines that needed two people, but nobody wanted to be her partner. A tall boy with messy brown hair bumped into her as he rushed past, not even stopping to say sorry. Mia sighed and sat down, opening her notebook to the page with her favorite dance moves. The competition was only two weeks away, and without a partner, she couldn't enter. She doodled little stars in the margin of her notebook while watching everyone else having fun." },
    { "id": 4, "text": "Mia sighed as her pencil traced another tiny star, making a whole galaxy in her notebook. The gym buzzed with laughter and music while pairs of students counted steps and practiced spins. Coach Martinez clapped her hands, giving instructions to the dancers who nodded eagerly. Mia slouched lower in her seat on the bleachers, wishing she could disappear. She had asked three different boys to be her partner, but they all already had someone. The competition was only two weeks away, and without a partner, she couldn't enter. Just then, the gym door opened and Alex, the new kid who had transferred last month, walked in looking just as lost as she felt. He stood awkwardly by the water fountain, watching the dancers with a nervous expression. Mia tapped her pencil against her notebook, wondering if maybe she had one more chance to find a dance partner after all." },
    { "id": 5, "text": "Mia looked around the classroom, her eyes landing on Jake, the new kid who sat two rows over. He had mentioned during his introduction last week that he used to take dance lessons at his old school. Maybe he didn't have a partner either. She gathered her courage and walked over during the break between classes. \"Hey Jake,\" she said, her voice coming out higher than she intended. \"I was wondering if you already had a partner for the dance competition?\" Jake looked up from his math homework, seeming surprised that someone was talking to him. \"No, actually. I was thinking about skipping it since I don't know anyone yet.\" Mia smiled, feeling a flutter of hope. \"Well, now you know me. And I really need a partner if I'm going to enter. What do you think?\"" },
    { "id": 6, "text": "Mia scanned the gym nervously, her hands fidgeting with the strap of her dance bag. Coach Martinez was pairing up the last few students, but soon there would be nobody left. The colorful streamers hanging from the ceiling seemed to mock her loneliness. Just as she considered backing out of the competition altogether, someone tapped her shoulder. It was Ethan, the quiet boy from her math class who always got perfect scores. \"Need a partner?\" he asked with a small smile. \"I've been practicing at home, but I don't have anyone to dance with either.\" Mia blinked in surprise. She never imagined Ethan would be interested in dancing. His glasses slipped down his nose as he waited for her answer. The gym lights reflected off his braces when he smiled hopefully. Maybe this wouldn't be so bad after all." },
    { "id": 7, "text": "Mia smiled as she watched her classmates twirl around the gym floor. The past few weeks had been full of surprises. After that first day when she'd felt so alone, Jake had asked to be her partner, and they'd practiced every afternoon since then. Now, as the music played and they moved together, Mia felt confident in their routine. When the competition finally arrived, Mia and Jake performed without a single mistake. The crowd cheered loudly as they finished with a perfect spin. Later, as they stood on the stage with their first-place trophy, Mia couldn't believe how much had changed. \"We make a good team,\" Jake said, high-fiving her. Mia nodded, looking around at the decorated gym that had once seemed so scary. She had found not just a dance partner, but a new friend. Sometimes the best things happened when you were brave enough to stay, even when you wanted to run away." }
