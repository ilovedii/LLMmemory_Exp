    { "id": 1, "text": "Jake stood frozen at the entrance to the drama club room, his sweaty hand gripping the doorframe. Twenty pairs of eyes turned to stare at him. Being the new kid at Westlake Middle School was hard enough, but joining a club mid-semester felt like walking into a lion's den wearing meat pants. The drama teacher, Ms. Patel, clapped her hands together. \"Everyone, this is Jake! He's joining us today.\" A tall girl with bright blue hair waved enthusiastically while others mumbled hellos. Jake spotted an empty chair next to a boy who hadn't looked up from his phone. As Jake sat down, the boy whispered, \"I'm Theo. Stick with me and you'll survive this place.\" Jake smiled, relieved to find a potential friend so quickly. What he didn't notice was how Theo's eyes darted to the blue-haired girl, or the tiny smirk that formed on his lips." },
    { "id": 2, "text": "Jake followed Theo's gaze to the blue-haired girl who stood across the room. She was talking to Ms. Patel, gesturing excitedly about something. Jake remembered her waving at him earlier when he first walked into the drama club. \"That's Lily,\" Theo whispered, leaning closer. \"She's the best actress in the club and Ms. Patel's favorite.\" Jake nodded, watching as Lily pulled out a carton of chocolate milk from her backpack and took a sip. \"She always brings chocolate milk to rehearsals for good luck,\" Theo explained. \"If you want to get on her good side, that's your ticket in.\" Jake considered this information. Maybe bringing milk to the next meeting would help him make friends faster. He was still feeling nervous about being the new kid, but Theo's advice gave him something concrete to try."},
    { "id": 3, "text": "The next day, Jake arrived at drama club fifteen minutes early, clutching a small carton of chocolate milk in his hand. He spotted Lily arranging chairs in a circle for the meeting. Her blue hair was pulled into a messy bun today. Jake took a deep breath and walked over to her. \"Hi, I'm Jake. I brought this for you,\" he said, holding out the chocolate milk. Lily's eyes widened with surprise, then she smiled. \"Thanks! But how did you know?\" Before Jake could answer, Ms. Patel entered carrying a cardboard box. \"Attention everyone! Today we'll be assigning roles for our spring play, 'The Lost Crown of Westlake,'\" she announced. Jake noticed a plastic crown poking out from the box. Theo appeared beside him and nudged his shoulder. \"Perfect timing with the milk. Now you might actually have a shot at getting a decent part instead of being Tree Number Three.\"" },
    { "id": 4, "text": "Jake's face turned red as he stammered, \"I overheard you yesterday talking about chocolate milk being your favorite.\" Lily laughed and took a sip. Ms. Patel clapped her hands to get everyone's attention as more students filed in. \"The Lost Crown of Westlake is about a magical helmet that grants wishes to whoever wears it,\" she explained, pulling out not just a crown but also a silver helmet with stars painted on it. Jake watched as students began signing up for auditions on a clipboard. Being new at Westlake Middle School made everything feel overwhelming, but drama club seemed different. When the clipboard reached him, Jake noticed most roles were already claimed. Only two remained: the Wise Wizard or the Guardian of the Helmet. He hesitated, pen hovering over the paper. Theo leaned over and whispered, \"Guardian gets to wear that cool helmet the whole show. Just saying.\"" },
    { "id": 5, "text": "Jake scribbled his name next to \"Guardian of the Helmet\" with a quick glance at Theo, who gave him a thumbs up. As Ms. Patel collected the clipboard, a small commotion erupted near the prop table. A fluffy orange cat had somehow wandered into the drama room and jumped onto the table, knocking over several items. Its paw batted playfully at the silver helmet. \"Mr. Whiskers!\" the blue-haired girl called out, rushing to scoop up the cat. \"Sorry, everyone. He follows me everywhere.\" Ms. Patel sighed but smiled. \"Lily, please take your cat outside.\" Jake watched as Lily carried the cat toward the door, but not before Mr. Whiskers stretched out his paw and knocked the helmet directly into Jake's lap. The room went quiet. \"Well,\" Ms. Patel said with raised eyebrows, \"it seems our Guardian has been chosen by fate.\"" },
    { "id": 6, "text": "Jake's face turned red as everyone stared at him holding the helmet. \"I guess Mr. Whiskers made the decision for us,\" he said with a nervous laugh. Ms. Patel nodded approvingly while Lily turned back, her blue hair swinging as she smiled at Jake. After rehearsal, Theo nudged Jake's shoulder. \"Dude, you should bring some milk tomorrow,\" he whispered. \"Lily loves when people are nice to her cat.\" Jake nodded, making a mental note. As they gathered their backpacks, Jake carefully placed the silver helmet in his bag. The metal felt strangely warm against his fingers. Suddenly, a strange humming sound came from inside it. Jake pulled the helmet out, and everyone gasped. A small golden harp symbol had appeared on its side, glowing faintly. \"That's... not part of the prop design,\" Ms. Patel said, her eyes wide with surprise." },
    { "id": 7, "text": "\"Jake, you brought milk for Lily?\" Ms. Patel said, her eyes wide with surprise. The entire drama club turned to stare at Jake, who stood frozen with the chocolate milk carton in his hand. Lily walked over, smiling as she accepted his gift. \"Thanks, Jake. That was really thoughtful.\" The blue-haired girl Jake had noticed earlier laughed and whispered something to Theo. Ms. Patel clapped her hands together. \"Well, since Jake has shown such dedication already, I think he'd be perfect for the Guardian role in 'The Lost Crown of Westlake'!\" Jake couldn't believe his luck—the role with the helmet that would hide his face throughout the show. As weeks passed, Jake grew more confident. On opening night, when he placed the crown on Lily's head—played by the princess—the audience erupted in applause. After the final bow, Theo patted Jake's shoulder. \"See? I told you you'd survive.\" Jake smiled, finally feeling like he belonged in drama club." }
