    { "id": 1, "text": "Mia wiped her sweaty palms on her jeans as she stared at the sign-up sheet for the regional dance competition. Her dream was right there - just a signature away. But the rules were clear: pairs only. She needed a partner, and fast. That's when Tyler Rodriguez walked by, his varsity jacket making him impossible to miss in the crowded hallway. \"Hey,\" she called out before she could stop herself. Tyler turned, eyebrows raised in surprise that Mia Jenkins was talking to him. They barely moved in the same circles at Westlake Middle School. \"I need a huge favor,\" Mia said, the words tumbling out. \"Be my dance partner for the competition, and I'll pretend to be your girlfriend for a month so Kaitlyn will finally notice you.\" She held her breath as Tyler's confused expression slowly transformed into a grin." },
    { "id": 2, "text": "\"So, you want me to pretend to be your girlfriend for a month, and in return, you'll be my dance partner for the regional competition?\" Tyler asked, adjusting his varsity jacket. Mia nodded quickly, her eyes hopeful as they stood in the hallway of Westlake Middle School. \"Deal,\" Tyler said, extending his hand. Mia shook it firmly, relief washing over her face. The regional dance competition had been her dream for months, but the pairs-only rule had nearly crushed her hopes until this idea struck her. Tyler glanced down the hall where Kaitlyn was organizing her locker. \"When do we start practice?\" he asked, already imagining how jealous Kaitlyn might get seeing him with Mia. Mia pulled out her phone calendar. \"Tomorrow after school? The gym should be empty.\" She paused, then added with a smile, \"And don't worry, I'll make sure Kaitlyn notices us together at lunch tomorrow.\"" },
    { "id": 3, "text": "Tyler nodded, feeling both nervous and excited about their plan. \"Thanks, Mia. I hope this works.\" The next day at Westlake Middle School, Tyler waited by the cafeteria entrance, his varsity jacket zipped up despite the warm spring air. He spotted Mia walking toward him, her dance shoes poking out of her backpack. She waved and linked her arm through his as they entered the lunch room together. \"Remember,\" she whispered, \"laugh at my jokes and look interested.\" Tyler followed her lead, noticing how Kaitlyn and her friends glanced their way from across the room. As they sat down, Mia pulled a bright red apple from her lunch bag and placed it between them. \"I brought this for you,\" she said loudly enough for nearby tables to hear. \"Partners should look out for each other, right?\" Tyler smiled genuinely, realizing that this fake relationship might be easier than he thought." },
    { "id": 4, "text": "Tyler adjusted his varsity jacket as he and Mia walked through the hallways of Westlake Middle School. \"So when's the first practice for this regional dance competition?\" he asked, trying to sound casual. Mia pulled out her phone and showed him the schedule. \"Three times a week after school. I hope that works with your basketball practice.\" Tyler nodded, suddenly realizing what he'd gotten himself into. Dancing in front of people seemed scarier than asking Kaitlyn to the school dance. As they passed the bulletin board, Mia stopped to sign them up. \"Look,\" she pointed to a poster with a trophy shaped like crossed swords. \"First prize is $500 and a chance to compete at state level.\" Tyler's eyes widened. Maybe this fake relationship had more benefits than just getting Kaitlyn's attention. The money could help him buy that new gaming system he'd been saving for." },
    { "id": 5, "text": "Tyler counted the money Mia had given him for agreeing to be her dance partner. Fifty dollars wasn't bad for something he'd probably have done anyway, since Mia was his friend. Plus, the regional dance competition was only three weeks away, which meant three weeks of Mia pretending to be his girlfriend at Westlake Middle School. That was plenty of time for Kaitlyn to notice him. He stuffed the cash into his wallet and zipped up his varsity jacket against the cold. As he walked home, he passed the pet store where a bright orange goldfish caught his eye. The store sign advertised a special deal - dance lessons at the community center came with a free pet fish. Tyler stopped in his tracks. Maybe he could surprise Mia with some actual dance skills instead of just showing up and following her lead. That way, they might actually have a chance at winning." },
    { "id": 6, "text": "Mia and Tyler stayed after school in the empty gym, practicing their dance routine for the third time that week. Sweat dripped down Tyler's face as he counted the steps under his breath. \"One, two, three, four—sorry!\" he mumbled after stepping on Mia's foot again. Mia sighed but didn't get angry. \"We've got six weeks until the competition,\" she reminded him, pointing to the big clock on the gym wall. \"That's enough time to get better.\" She showed him the dance move again, slower this time. Tyler watched carefully, then tried to copy her. His movements were stiff, but he was trying hard. \"The $500 prize would help my family a lot,\" Mia admitted quietly. \"My mom needs a new car.\" Tyler nodded, suddenly more determined. He took Mia's hand again, positioned himself correctly, and they started from the beginning." },
    { "id": 7, "text": "The music filled the studio as Tyler guided Mia through the steps with newfound confidence. After weeks of practice, their movements had become synchronized, their awkwardness replaced by fluid motion. \"We might actually have a chance at winning that $500 prize,\" Tyler whispered as they completed a perfect turn. On competition day, they waited nervously backstage, Mia no longer wiping sweaty palms but standing tall beside him. When their names were called, they stepped onto the floor, the spotlight catching a small green leaf pin Mia had attached to Tyler's jacket for luck. Their performance wasn't perfect—Tyler missed one step—but their chemistry was undeniable. As they took their final bow to thunderous applause, Tyler realized something important: what had begun as a business arrangement had blossomed into genuine friendship. They didn't win first place, but their second-place finish and the experience they shared was worth far more than money." }
