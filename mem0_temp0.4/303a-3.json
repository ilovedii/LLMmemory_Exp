    { "id": 1, "text": "Jake stood frozen in the doorway of the robotics club, clutching his backpack straps. Twenty pairs of eyes turned to stare at him. The room buzzed with activity â€“ kids huddled around tables covered with metal parts, wires, and tools he couldn't name. He spotted Mia, the only person he knew, waving enthusiastically from across the room. They'd been friends in elementary school before Jake moved away. Now back as an eighth grader, he'd joined robotics club on her suggestion. \"Everyone, this is Jake!\" Mia announced loudly. \"He's amazing with computers!\" The club president, a tall boy with thick glasses, looked Jake up and down. \"We'll see about that,\" he said with a smirk that made Jake's stomach twist. \"We have team selections today, and nobody wants dead weight on their team.\"" },
    { "id": 2, "text": "The club president clapped his hands and pointed to a whiteboard with team names. \"Everyone pick your groups for the competition,\" he announced. Jake stood awkwardly in the corner, watching as students quickly formed clusters around the room. No one approached him. Mia gave Jake an encouraging smile from across the room, but she had already joined a team with three other girls. Jake's stomach tightened as he remembered why he'd joined robotics club in the first place - Mia had convinced him his computer skills would be valuable here. Now he wasn't so sure. A small group in the back caught his attention when one boy dropped a box of orange circuit boards. As Jake helped gather the scattered pieces, he noticed they were building a robotic arm with a carrot-detection sensor. \"We need someone who can code the visual recognition software,\" the boy said. \"Can you do that?\""},
    { "id": 3, "text": "Jake hesitated, then nodded. \"Yeah, I can code that. I've worked with visual recognition before.\" The boy with the circuit boards grinned and extended his hand. \"I'm Theo. This is Zack and Lin.\" Jake joined their group, feeling a weight lift from his shoulders. As they settled at their workstation, Jake noticed a bright red apple sitting next to their robot parts. \"That's our test object,\" Lin explained. \"We started with apple detection because they're simple shapes, but carrots are trickier.\" Jake opened his laptop and began typing code while the others assembled the mechanical components. Across the room, the club president watched with narrowed eyes. When Jake successfully ran his first test program, making the partial arm twitch toward the apple, Theo cheered and high-fived him. For the first time since entering the robotics club, Jake felt like he belonged. Maybe Mia had been right about his skills after all." },
    { "id": 4, "text": "Jake stared at the small robot on the table, surprised that his code had actually worked. The motors whirred to life, and the machine smoothly navigated the obstacle course that the club president had set up as a test. The tall boy with thick glasses nodded with approval, his earlier skepticism fading. \"Not bad for your first day,\" he said, offering Jake a rare smile. Around the room, other club members looked up from their projects with newfound interest. One girl even clapped. Jake felt his face grow warm with pride as he remembered how Mia had convinced him to join the club after he moved back to town. \"See? I told you that you'd fit right in,\" Mia whispered, bumping his shoulder with hers. But their celebration was cut short when the lights suddenly flickered and died, leaving the robotics lab in darkness." },
    { "id": 5, "text": "Emergency lights flickered on, casting an eerie red glow across the robotics lab. Jake fumbled for his phone, turning on its flashlight. \"Power outage,\" the club president announced, already checking the circuit breakers near the door. Jake noticed a fish-shaped USB drive hanging from Mia's backpack. \"Hey, doesn't your dad work at the power company?\" he asked, remembering their elementary school days when Mia had brought in cool gadgets from her father's job. Mia nodded, pulling out her phone. \"I'll text him to see what's happening.\" While they waited, Jake's robot suddenly powered back on by itself, its small battery backup system working perfectly. The machine's lights created a path across the darkened room. \"That's weird,\" Jake said, watching as his robot moved toward a metal cabinet that nobody had opened since he arrived. The club members gathered around as the little machine bumped repeatedly against the cabinet door." },
    { "id": 6, "text": "\"What's in there?\" the club president asked, adjusting his thick glasses as he stepped closer to the cabinet. Mia pulled out a small key from her pocket. \"This is the storage for old projects. My dad donated some equipment last year.\" The cabinet door swung open, revealing dusty electronics and a strange round device with clock-like hands on its face. Jake recognized it from elementary school science fair - Mia's father had shown them a power grid monitoring system. \"That's a voltage regulator,\" Mia explained, picking it up carefully. \"Dad said the school could have it when they upgraded systems.\" Jake noticed wires connecting to a small computer inside the cabinet. The club president whistled. \"Someone's been using this to hack into the school's power system.\" A timer on the device showed three minutes remaining. Jake's hands trembled slightly as he examined the wiring. \"I think I can disconnect it before whatever's planned happens.\"" },
    { "id": 7, "text": "Jake's fingers worked quickly, tracing the wires to find the main connection. \"Hand me those scissors,\" he told Mia, pointing to a tool tray nearby. The club president leaned over Jake's shoulder, his glasses sliding down his nose as he watched intently. With thirty seconds remaining, Jake carefully snipped the red wire, then the blue one. The timer froze at 0:12. Everyone exhaled with relief. \"You really do have skills,\" the president admitted, extending his hand. \"Welcome to Robotics Club.\" Later, as they cleaned up, Jake found a small leaf stuck to the cabinet door - it must have blown in through the window. He smiled, tucking it into his notebook as a reminder of his first day. Mia bumped his shoulder playfully. \"Told you you'd fit in here.\" Jake nodded, finally feeling like he belonged somewhere at his new school." }
