    { "id": 1, "text": "Jake stood frozen in the doorway of the computer lab, clutching his permission slip. Twenty pairs of eyes turned to stare at him. The Coding Club was already packed with students hunched over keyboards, their faces illuminated by blue screen light. Ms. Patel waved him in with a smile. \"Everyone, this is Jake. He's joining us today.\" A few kids nodded, but most returned to their screens. A girl with purple-streaked hair scooted her chair over. \"I'm Zoe. You can sit with us.\" She pointed to her group, where two boys were arguing about something called Python. Jake slid into the empty chair, noticing how everyone seemed to already have friends and inside jokes. Zoe leaned closer, whispering, \"Don't worry about Marcus and Deon. They're always like this. But fair warning—in this club, someone always tries to take credit for someone else's code.\"" },
    { "id": 2, "text": "Jake nodded at Zoe's warning, feeling both nervous and excited. The computer in front of him displayed a blank coding screen, unlike the others filled with colorful lines of text. Marcus stopped arguing with Deon and glanced over at Jake. \"You know anything about game design?\" he asked. Before Jake could answer, Ms. Patel clapped her hands. \"Today's challenge is to create a simple game where a rabbit collects carrots,\" she announced. The room buzzed with excitement. Jake had made something similar in his old school but stayed quiet. As students began typing, Zoe showed him how to access the program. \"Last month, Trey copied Alicia's entire project and claimed it was his,\" she whispered. Jake looked around the room, wondering who Trey was, while his fingers hovered uncertainly over the keyboard. This challenge might be his chance to fit in—if he could remember how to code a jumping rabbit."},
    { "id": 3, "text": "Jake stared at the screen, his fingers hovering over the keyboard. The code for the jumping rabbit animation was somewhere in his brain, but he couldn't quite grab it. Ms. Patel walked by and gave him an encouraging nod. \"Try using the loop function,\" she suggested before moving to help another student. Jake typed a few lines, deleted them, then tried again. Beside him, Zoe was already making her rabbit hop across the screen in perfect arcs. \"Here,\" she whispered, sliding an apple across the desk to him. \"Brain food. My mom always packs extra.\" Jake took a bite, the sweet crunch somehow clearing his thoughts. Suddenly, he remembered the missing piece - the gravity variable! His fingers flew across the keyboard with new confidence. When his rabbit finally jumped, completing a perfect arc across the screen, Jake couldn't help but smile. Maybe Coding Club wouldn't be so bad after all." },
    { "id": 4, "text": "As the bell rang, Jake packed up his laptop, feeling better about Coding Club than he had all week. \"Nice work today,\" Zoe said, gathering her things. \"We're working on game projects next week. Want to team up?\" Before Jake could answer, a tall boy with spiky hair approached. \"Hey, I'm Marcus,\" he said, eyeing Jake's screen. \"Cool rabbit animation. I could show you some advanced tricks.\" Jake remembered Zoe's warning about someone claiming credit for others' code. \"Thanks, but I think I'll figure it out myself,\" Jake replied politely. Ms. Patel clapped her hands for attention. \"Everyone, our coding competition is next month! The winning team gets to represent our school at the state level.\" Jake glanced at Zoe, who smiled back. Maybe this was his chance to prove himself in Coding Club and make real friends too." },
    { "id": 5, "text": "Jake took a deep breath and walked toward Zoe's group, his permission slip still crumpled in his sweaty palm. The computer lab buzzed with activity as students typed away on their keyboards. \"Hey, glad you could join us,\" Zoe said, sliding over to make room. She introduced him to her friends, Alex and Priya, who were working on a game about a fish that collected trash in the ocean to clean up pollution. \"We need someone who's good at animation,\" Alex explained, showing Jake their colorful but jerky fish character. Jake smiled, remembering the animation tutorials he'd practiced at home. When Marcus from across the room glanced over with a frown, Zoe whispered, \"Don't mind him. He's the one who sometimes takes credit for other people's code.\" Jake nodded, feeling both nervous and excited as he pulled up the keyboard and began suggesting improvements to make the fish swim more smoothly." },
    { "id": 6, "text": "\"That looks good,\" Zoe said, leaning over Jake's shoulder to watch the colorful fish dart across the screen. \"You fixed the glitch in the tail movement.\" Jake smiled, feeling more comfortable now. Ms. Patel walked by their table, nodding with approval at his code. The classroom clock ticked loudly as they worked, reminding everyone they only had twenty minutes left. Jake noticed Marcus and Deon whispering at the next table, occasionally glancing his way. \"Don't mind them,\" Zoe whispered. \"Remember what I said about people taking credit? Last month, Marcus tried to put his name on Lily's game design.\" Jake nodded and focused back on the screen. Suddenly, the fish animation froze, and an error message popped up. The whole program crashed. Jake's heart sank as his progress disappeared. \"Don't worry,\" Zoe said, pointing to a backup folder. \"I'll show you how we save our work every five minutes in this club.\"" },
    { "id": 7, "text": "Zoe clicked a button on her computer, and a small notification appeared. \"See? Auto-save every five minutes. We learned that lesson after Marcus lost his entire game project last semester.\" Jake nodded, feeling more comfortable in the Coding Club with each passing minute. As they worked together on their animation, Jake noticed a small leaf icon in the corner of the screen. \"What's that?\" he asked. Zoe explained it was the club's symbol for completed projects - when you finished something good enough to share, you earned a digital leaf for your profile. By the end of the session, Jake and Zoe had not only fixed the jumping rabbit animation but added special effects too. Ms. Patel awarded them both leaf badges, and Jake couldn't help smiling. He'd found his place at the new school, with new friends who appreciated his coding skills. \"Same time Thursday?\" Zoe asked. Jake nodded eagerly. \"I wouldn't miss it.\"" }
