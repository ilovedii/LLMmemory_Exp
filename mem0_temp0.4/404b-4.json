    { "id": 1, "text": "Mia froze at the entrance to the school gym, watching as pairs of students practiced their routines for the upcoming regional dance competition. Her best friend Ethan had promised to be her partner, but he'd just texted that he broke his ankle skateboarding. Without a partner, she couldn't compete. As she turned to leave, she bumped straight into Leo Chen, the quiet new kid who somehow managed to be both invisible and the center of attention whenever he moved. \"Sorry,\" she mumbled, but then noticed how gracefully he steadied himself. \"You dance?\" The words tumbled out before she could stop them. Leo nodded slightly. \"I need a partner for regionals. It's in three weeks.\" His eyes widened with interest, then narrowed suspiciously. \"What's the catch?\" Mia bit her lip. \"My ex thinks I've moved on. If we practice together, maybe you could pretend to be my boyfriend at school?\"" },
    { "id": 2, "text": "Mia's eyes widened at her own words. She hadn't meant to blurt that out, especially not to Jake Sullivan, the captain of the basketball team. Jake raised an eyebrow, his expression unreadable as he took a sip from his carton of milk. \"Pretend to be your boyfriend?\" he repeated slowly. The cafeteria suddenly felt too crowded, too loud. Mia wanted to disappear into the floor. But then Jake smiled, revealing the dimple in his left cheek. \"I'll do it, but on one condition,\" he said, placing the empty milk carton on the table between them. \"You have to help me pass Ms. Garcia's English class. I'm failing, and if I don't get my grades up, I can't play in the championship.\" Mia hesitated, weighing her options. A fake boyfriend who could dance in exchange for tutoring? It seemed like a fair deal."},
    { "id": 3, "text": "Mia nodded slowly, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. \"Deal. I'll help you with English if you pretend to be my boyfriend for my cousin's wedding next month.\" She didn't mention that her ex would be there, watching her every move. Jake grinned and shook her hand firmly, sealing their arrangement. Just then, Leo Chen walked by their table, carrying his lunch tray. Mia noticed the dance competition flyer sticking out from his notebook. A sudden idea struck her. Maybe Jake wasn't her only option. Leo needed a dance partner since Ethan broke his ankle last week, and Mia had been looking for a way to enter the regional competition. She watched Leo sit alone at the corner table, his movements graceful even while just setting down his tray. Mia bit her lip, wondering if she'd made her deal with Jake too quickly." },
    { "id": 4, "text": "Mia watched Jake walk away, his confident stride making her doubt their arrangement. She had agreed to help him with his math homework if he would pretend to be her dance partner at the upcoming showcase. With Leo Chen unavailable and Ethan's broken ankle, she was desperate for someone to fill in. Jake wasn't a dancer like Leo, who had moved to their school last month and quickly gained attention for his amazing skills. But Jake was athletic and could learn the basic steps. Mia pulled out her phone and scrolled through the competition requirements again. Her eyes widened when she saw a new safety rule - all lifts required partners to wear protective HELMETS during practice sessions. This complicated everything. How could she convince Jake to wear a dorky helmet when he was already reluctant about dancing? Mia sighed and headed to the gym, hoping to catch Jake before basketball practice ended." },
    { "id": 5, "text": "Mia pushed open the heavy gym doors and spotted Jake dribbling across the court with his teammates. She waited on the bleachers until Coach Wilson blew the final whistle. As players dispersed to the locker room, Mia approached Jake, nervously adjusting her backpack strap. \"Hey Jake, got a minute?\" she asked. Jake nodded, wiping sweat from his forehead with a towel. \"I heard about Ethan's ankle,\" Mia said. \"That's tough luck before the regional dance competition.\" Jake frowned, \"Yeah, Leo Chen's without a partner now. He's really talented but too shy to ask anyone else.\" Mia's eyes widened as an idea formed. Perhaps she could help Leo while solving her own problem. If she became Leo's dance partner, maybe he'd agree to her boyfriend charade to make her ex jealous. As they talked, a small dog with a PAW-print collar darted across the gym floor, causing both to laugh at the unexpected interruption." },
    { "id": 6, "text": "\"That's Harp!\" Mia exclaimed, rushing after the small dog. Leo followed behind as they chased the furry escapee around the gym equipment. The dog finally stopped at a woman setting up musical instruments for the school's upcoming talent show. \"Sorry about that,\" the woman said, scooping up the dog. \"Harp gets excited around new people.\" As Mia petted the dog, she noticed a sign-up sheet for the talent show. An idea sparked in her mind. \"Leo,\" she whispered, \"what if we enter the talent show together? We could practice our dance routine and see if we work well as partners before committing to the regional competition.\" Leo hesitated, glancing at Jake who was watching them from across the gym with narrowed eyes. The basketball captain clearly wasn't happy seeing them together. Leo nodded slowly. \"Okay, let's try it. But what about Jake? I thought you two had some kind of arrangement?\"" },
    { "id": 7, "text": "Mia sighed, twisting a strand of hair around her finger. \"Jake and I had a deal. He'd pretend to be my boyfriend if I tutored him, but it never felt right.\" She looked at Leo with honest eyes. \"I'd rather dance with someone who cares about the performance, not just the attention.\" They signed up for the talent show together, practicing every day after school. When the big night arrived, Mia and Leo performed their routine perfectly, even with the required safety helmets for their impressive lifts. The audience cheered wildly, and Jake watched from the back, finally understanding what real partnership looked like. After winning first place, Leo handed Mia a small bottle of glitter he called his \"lucky potion.\" \"For our regional competition,\" he said with a smile. Mia realized she'd found more than just a dance partnerâ€”she'd found someone who truly supported her dreams." }
