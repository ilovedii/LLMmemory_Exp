    { "id": 1, "text": "Mia wiped her sweaty palms on her jeans as she stared at the signup sheet for the regional dance competition. Her heart raced when she spotted Tyler's name already on the list. He was the best dancer in school, and partnering with him would guarantee attention from the talent scouts. The problem? Tyler barely knew she existed. Behind her, a group of popular girls whispered and pointed in her direction, probably wondering why someone so average would even consider entering. Mia took a deep breath and scribbled her name on the sheet. As she turned to leave, she bumped right into Carlos, her childhood friend who had recently returned after moving away for three years. \"Hey, I have a crazy idea,\" he said with a mischievous grin. \"What if we pretended to be a couple? Tyler always wants what he can't have.\"" },
    { "id": 2, "text": "Mia stood in front of the bulletin board, pen hovering over the sign-up sheet for the regional dance competition. Her hand trembled slightly as she wrote her name. She glanced across the hallway where Tyler, the best dancer in school, was laughing with his friends. Mia had barely spoken two words to him, but she desperately wanted him as her dance partner. Carlos appeared beside her, his familiar smile a comfort after being away for three years. \"Still crushing on Tyler, huh?\" he whispered, following her gaze. \"You know what they say about him—he only wants what he can't have.\" Carlos tapped his chin thoughtfully. \"What if we pretend to be a couple? Make him jealous enough to notice you?\" Mia's eyes widened at her childhood friend's suggestion. It was risky and a little dishonest, but it might just be the perfect strategy to catch Tyler's attention before partner selections next week."},
    { "id": 3, "text": "Mia chewed her lip as she considered Carlos's plan. \"You really think it would work?\" she asked, tucking her hair behind her ear. The hallway buzzed with students, some pointing at the competition sign-up sheet. Carlos nodded confidently and draped his arm around her shoulders. \"Trust me. Tyler only notices what he can't have. If he thinks you're taken, he'll suddenly see you.\" Mia's stomach fluttered with both excitement and worry. This wasn't how she imagined getting Tyler's attention, but partner selections were only a week away. She needed to act fast if she wanted a chance with the school's star dancer. The regional competition could attract scouts who might notice her talent. \"Okay,\" she finally agreed, \"let's try your crazy plan.\" Carlos grinned and squeezed her shoulder as they walked past Tyler's group, already playing the part of the happy couple." },
    { "id": 4, "text": "Mia felt her cheeks grow warm as they passed by. Tyler glanced up from his conversation, his eyes lingering on her for a moment longer than usual. Maybe Carlos's plan was working already! The music in the school gymnasium echoed off the walls as dancers practiced their routines. Mia had dreamed about this regional competition for months, knowing dance scouts would be watching. She needed Tyler as her partner if she wanted any chance of being noticed. Carlos leaned closer and whispered, \"See? He's watching you now.\" Mia nodded slightly, remembering how different Carlos looked after his three-year absence. He had grown taller, more confident. A loud crash interrupted her thoughts as someone knocked over a speaker. The dance instructor clapped her hands and announced, \"Everyone find your partners! We need to decide final pairings by tomorrow!\" Mia's stomach tightened—this was her chance, but she needed to act fast." },
    { "id": 5, "text": "Mia took a deep breath and walked straight toward Tyler, who was stretching near the studio mirrors. The registration deadline for the regional dance competition would end in thirty minutes, and she needed a partner now. \"Hey Tyler,\" she said, trying to sound casual despite her racing heart. \"I was wondering if you'd consider being my partner for the regionals?\" Tyler looked up, surprise crossing his face as he recognized her from their shared math class. Before he could answer, Carlos appeared beside Mia, casually draping his arm around her shoulders. \"There you are, babe,\" he said loudly enough for everyone to hear. Mia froze, suddenly remembering their ridiculous plan to pretend to be a couple. She hadn't expected Carlos to start so soon! Tyler's expression changed from surprise to interest as he glanced between them. \"I didn't know you two were together,\" he said, a strange look in his eyes like a fish that had spotted unexpected bait." },
    { "id": 6, "text": "I froze, my sign-up form for the regional dance competition still clutched in my hand. Tyler stood there, looking between Carlos and me with raised eyebrows. \"We're not—\" I started to say, but Carlos slipped his arm around my shoulders. \"Just recently,\" Carlos said with a smile that didn't quite reach his eyes. The hallway clock ticked loudly above us, reminding me that dance team tryouts would start in fifteen minutes. Tyler nodded slowly, his championship trophy pin glinting on his jacket. \"Cool. Well, I need a partner for the competition. Thought you might be interested, Mia.\" He shrugged and walked away before I could respond. I elbowed Carlos hard in the ribs. \"What was that about? I wanted to dance with Tyler to get noticed by the scouts!\" Carlos rubbed his side. \"Trust me, this is better. He only notices what he can't have.\"" },
    { "id": 7, "text": "Mia watched as Tyler practiced his dance routine, his movements fluid and perfect. She sighed, knowing her plan with Carlos was working—Tyler had finally noticed her after they pretended to be a couple. But something felt wrong. Carlos sat beside her, helping her stretch for the regional competition they'd entered together after Tyler had rejected her partnership. \"You know,\" Carlos said, \"sometimes what we're looking for is right in front of us.\" He handed her a maple leaf that had fallen through the open gym window. Mia smiled, remembering how they used to collect leaves as children before he moved away. When they took the dance floor later that day, Mia realized she didn't need Tyler's attention anymore. Carlos was the better partner—in dance and in life. As they finished their routine to thunderous applause, Mia knew the scouts were watching, but more importantly, she was finally seeing what had been there all along." }
