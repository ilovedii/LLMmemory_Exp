    { "id": 1, "text": "Jake stood frozen in the doorway of the drama club room. Twenty pairs of eyes turned to stare at him. The drama teacher, Ms. Patel, waved him in with enthusiasm that made his stomach flip. \"Everyone, this is Jake! He just moved here last week.\" Jake forced a smile and shuffled inside, clutching his backpack straps. The room buzzed with energy as students rehearsed lines and laughed together. In the corner, a group of kids who clearly knew each other well were taking selfies and sharing snacks. One girl with bright blue hair caught his eye and smiled. Maybe making friends wouldn't be impossible after all. What Jake didn't notice was the tall boy in the back, watching him with narrowed eyes. The same boy who had promised the lead role to his best friend, and wasn't about to let some new kid take the spotlight." },
    { "id": 2, "text": "The tall boy, whose name was Ethan, crossed his arms and whispered something to a friend beside him. Jake noticed this and felt his stomach tighten. He had hoped drama club would be different from his old school, where he'd always felt like an outsider. Ms. Patel clapped her hands and announced they would be performing \"Romeo and Juliet\" for the spring show. \"Auditions start tomorrow,\" she said with a smile. The girl with bright blue hair approached Jake after Ms. Patel finished speaking. \"Don't mind Ethan,\" she said. \"He's just protective of his friend Alex. They've been practicing all summer.\" She handed Jake a small carton of chocolate milk from her lunch bag. \"For good luck,\" she explained. \"I'm Zoe, by the way. If you need help with your audition, I know all the best monologues.\"" },
    { "id": 3, "text": "Jake smiled at Zoe, grateful for her kindness. \"Thanks for the milk. I could really use help with monologues. I've never done Shakespeare before.\" He took a sip as they walked toward the bulletin board where Ms. Patel had posted character descriptions. Other students crowded around, pointing excitedly at different roles. Jake noticed a plastic crown sitting on a nearby table - the prop for whoever would play the Prince of Verona. Ethan picked it up, placing it on his head with a confident grin. \"The crown fits perfectly,\" he announced to everyone. Alex laughed and gave him a high-five. Jake felt his confidence shrinking until Zoe nudged him. \"Don't worry about them,\" she whispered. \"Ms. Patel always gives roles based on talent, not who's been here longest. Meet me in the library after school and we'll find your perfect audition piece.\"" },
    { "id": 4, "text": "Jake met Zoe at the library after school, finding her already surrounded by Shakespeare books. \"I brought options,\" she said, spreading out several plays. As they flipped through pages, Jake spotted a dusty prop helmet on a nearby shelf. \"That's from last year's medieval play,\" Zoe explained. \"Ms. Patel keeps old props for inspiration.\" Jake picked it up, feeling its weight. \"Maybe Romeo needs armor more than the Prince needs a crown,\" he joked. Zoe's eyes lit up. \"That's it! Instead of competing with Ethan for the Prince, you could try for Romeo. It's actually a bigger part.\" She pulled out Romeo and Juliet, marking several passages with sticky notes. Jake remembered how Ethan had promised the lead to Alex, but maybe there was another path. The helmet sat between them as they practiced reading lines, Jake's confidence growing with each page." },
    { "id": 5, "text": "\"You're getting better,\" Zoe said, pointing to a line Jake had just nailed. The motorcycle helmet on the table between them was part of their prop collection for the audition. Jake reached for the chocolate milk carton Zoe had given him earlier, taking a small sip for courage. Ms. Patel walked by, nodding approvingly at their practice session. \"Remember, Romeo needs to show both strength and vulnerability,\" she advised before continuing her rounds. Jake felt a flutter of hope in his chest. At his old school, no one had ever taken time to help him like this. Across the room, Ethan watched them closely while helping Alex with costumes. \"Don't worry about Ethan,\" Zoe whispered, noticing Jake's nervous glance. \"He'll warm up to you once he sees how good you are.\" Jake picked up the helmet, using it as Romeo might have used a shield, and began the next scene with newfound determination." },
    { "id": 6, "text": "\"To be or not to be,\" Jake recited, his voice growing stronger with each word. Ms. Patel nodded approvingly from her seat in the front row. The helmet felt heavy but somehow right in his hands, like it belonged there. Across the stage, Zoe gave him a thumbs-up, reminding him of how she'd handed him that chocolate milk earlier for good luck. The sweet gesture had calmed his nerves then, just as her encouragement did now. Even Ethan, who had made Jake's stomach tighten with that whispered comment to his friend, seemed impressed by the performance. As Jake finished his monologue, a small dog suddenly darted onto the stage, its paws clicking against the wooden floor. \"Paws off the stage!\" Ms. Patel called out, laughing. The unexpected visitor broke the tension, and everyone, including Jake, burst into laughter. Maybe drama club would work out after all." },
    { "id": 7, "text": "As the laughter died down, Ms. Patel clapped her hands. \"That's enough excitement for today. Remember, our first performance is in three weeks!\" Jake helped catch the little dog, returning it to a grateful freshman. After rehearsal, Zoe and Jake walked toward the exit, discussing their parts. \"You should definitely try for Romeo next time,\" Zoe said, just as the hallway clock chimed four. \"You've got the talent.\" Jake smiled, no longer needing to force it like he had on his first day. Even Ethan approached them, offering genuine praise about Jake's Hamlet. \"Drama club pizza party this weekend?\" Ethan asked, surprising Jake with the invitation. As they stepped outside into the afternoon sunshine, Jake felt something shift inside him. The new school didn't seem so scary anymore. With Shakespeare, new friends, and maybe even a leading role someday, he had finally found his place." }
